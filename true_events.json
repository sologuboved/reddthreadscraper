It happened in Michigan in 1927, and to this day it's still the deadliest mass killing in an American school.\n\nThe story starts with a 54-year-old farmer named Andrew Kehoe. Kehoe was by all accounts a frugal (some would say stingy) man, and even though he wasn't well-liked by his neighbors, his reputation for thrift allowed him to be elected as treasurer of the Bath County school board, and for a brief time as the township's clerk as well. He lost a 1926 election for the clerk position, however, after running on a campaign that emphasized low property taxes, and at that point he seems to have decided that he would perform an act of revenge against the citizens who had made it possible for the government to take away his hard-earned money.\n\nStarting that August, he gradually purchased several hundred pounds of both dynamite and a military surplus explosive called pyrotol, buying small quantities at numerous stores in the surrounding area in order to avoid suspicion. Under the guise of performing electrical work for the school district, he concealed these explosives inside the brick schoolhouse that held all of the district's children. His preparations were so involved that he entirely stopped working on his farm, and paying his mortgage. That December, he also purchased a rifle.\n\nIn May of 1927, Kehoe put his plan into action. He killed his wife, who was terminally ill with tuberculosis and had just been discharged from the hospital, and concealed her body inside a wheelbarrow in his farm's chicken coop, then surrounded it with all of his money and other earthly valuables, in order that they could be destroyed together. He then set about systematically sabotaging everything on his farm: cutting the wire on all his fences to render it unusable, killing the trees that shaded it, slicing through all of his grape vines at the root and then wiring the stems back into place so that nothing would seem amiss to a casual observer, and placing massive firebombs inside every structure on the farm. He also used wire restraints to hobble the legs of his two horses inside his barn, to prevent them from escaping from it once the bombs went off, and filled his truck with large quantities of explosives and metal shrapnel. Finally, he started a fire inside his home, and when the volunteer fire brigade arrived, he rode off and told them that they should leave, as they were his friends and they would soon be needed at the school.\n\nAt 8:45 that morning, fifteen minutes after the start of classes, an alarm clock that Kehoe had rigged as a detonator triggered the explosives he had concealed inside the north wing of the schoolhouse. A similar device in the south wing failed to activate, but the result of the one successful explosion was more than bad enough. In an instant, the entire north wing of the schoolhouse lifted several feet into the air, and community members miles away were jostled by the shockwave. Burning children were thrown through the windows of their classrooms, and the roof collapsed on top of those still inside. A local resident named Monte Ellsworth who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter described it thus: \"There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof.\"\n\nThe efforts of more than a hundred frantic men were not enough to lift the roof off of the children, so Ellsworth volunteered to go home to his farm and get a thick rope that could be used to drag it off of them. On his way there, he passed his neighbor Kehoe on road. Kehoe favored him with a big smile and a cheerful wave.\n\nWhen Kehoe arrived at the scene, he beckoned the school superintendent (whom he hated) over to his carriage. Witnesses saw the two struggling over Kehoe's gun, and then Kehoe fired a shot that triggered the bomb inside his carriage, spraying shrapnel into the crowd of rescuers and instantly killing both himself and his rival.\n\nEventually, the townspeople were able to clear enough of the wreckage to remove and treat all of the children who were still alive. They also discovered the second timer, and *the more than 500 pounds of explosives* that it was meant to detonate. You can see a picture of them [here](http://i.imgur.com/9zFP8NE.jpg).\n\nIn total, Kehoe killed 43 people that day: his wife, the superintendent, four bystanders who were too close to the truck bomb (including an eight-year-old boy who had escaped from the first explosion), and 38 people who had been inside the school, all but two of whom were children between the ages of seven and fourteen. 58 others were seriously injured. Kehoe's body was claimed by his sister, and secretly buried in an unmarked grave. The only explanation he left behind was a sign wired to a fence post at his farm - it read, \"Criminals are made, not born.\"\n\nWhenever I think about the Bath School disaster, I'm always taken aback by Kehoe's behavior. It's one thing to just snap in anger - while that's terrible, it's at least something you can understand on one level or another. But for more than half a year, Kehoe lived among these people, made small talk with them, and tipped his hat in the street, knowing that soon he would do his best to take all their children from them in one terrible morning of blood and fire. And as if that weren't enough, the sheer spite on display in every detail of his actions is just breathtaking. He went well out of his way to ensure that nothing he left behind would be of any use to anyone from that point forward. The horses didn't tax his land, but because someone might ride them after he was gone, they had to die. The vines didn't hurt his pride, but because they might nourish someone after he was gone, they had to die. He methodically sowed everything in his life with salt, and even his own death ensured that the survivors would gain no understanding or closure from his passing.", "ups": 1733, "utctimestamp": 1388751170.0}, {"authorname": "Saftpackung", "text": "During WWII, the german auxiliary cruiser \"Thor\" sunk the british [SS Britannia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Britannia_\\(1925\\)), eleven survivors who latched onto a small raft reported consistently that one of them was dragged in the depth by a giant squid..\n\n>Roland Hanewald: Das Tropenbuch.

Later, the computers identified four additional missiles in the air, all directed towards the Soviet Union.

He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog.[2]\n\nAccording to journalists who saw the video, Brandes may already have been too weakened from the blood loss to eat any of his penis.

It is generally accepted that he killed five, though some have written that he murdered only four while others say seven or more. The public, press, and even many junior police officers believed that the Ripper was responsible for nine slayings. The five that are generally accepted as the work of the Ripper are:\n\nMary Ann (Polly) - Nichols, murdered Friday, August 31, 1888.\n- Annie Chapman, murdered Saturday, September 8, 1888.\n- Elizabeth Stride, murdered Sunday, September 30, 1888.\n- Catharine Eddowes, also murdered that same date.\n- Mary Jane (Marie Jeanette) Kelly, murdered Friday, November 9, 1888.\n\nBesides these five there are good reasons to believe that the first victim was really Martha Tabram who was murdered Tuesday, August 7, 1888, and there are important considerations for questioning whether Stride was a Ripper victim. As to the actual number of women that the Ripper killed, Philip Sugden wrote in his excellent book, The Complete History of Jack the Ripper, \"There is no simple answer. In a sentence: at least four, probably six, just possibly eight.\"\n\nAll five of these listed plus Tabram were prostitutes and were killed between early August and early November 1888. All but Tabram and Kelly were killed outdoors and there is no evidence to suggest that any of them knew each other. They varied in both age and appearance. Most were drunk or thought to be drunk at the time they were killed.", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388769971.0}, {"authorname": "Back2zero", "text": "The first guy to get his head cut off in the Iraq war had his password \"stolen\" by one of the 911 hijackers years before.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Berg", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388774073.0}, {"authorname": "ShadNuke", "text": "How about anything the Westboro baptist church does?

We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. \n\nSo we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. \n\nOn Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosom's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist.\n\n Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. \n\nI'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/quotes?item=qt0457091", "ups": 0, "utctimestamp": 1388756746.0}, {"authorname": "bsk4", "text": "In 1937 an entire school blew up killing everybody.

I'll break it down in bullet points in reverse chronological order:\n\n- The most ridiculous claims (like people being skinned alive or merged with animals) were made up by certain ghost tour companies. You can hang out around the house, watch the tours go by, and hear a different version depending on the guide. It's fairly common knowledge that certain tour companies make shit up.\n\n- The only 'contemporary' account of the LaLauries was written by an abolitionist Brit, Harriet Martineau, who didn't show up in New Orleans until two years *after* the LaLauries disappeared. She was an obviously biased source in a time with lax journalistic standards. Besides that, fucking with tourists is a pastime in most cities (there's a reason why /r/neworleans has an Arby's logo and shoe in the header).   \n\n- The abolitionist writer would naturally be looking for real or exaggerated horrors of slavery to bring back to England. LaLaurie was the perfect target: an established name, kind of a bitch, and out of the country. There's a reason the abolitionist writer didn't pick someone who was still living in the South: they would have fought back against what today would be called libel. Anyone who owned a significant number of slaves would also have money and influence. \n\n- The abolitionist writer claimed that LaLaurie used big spiked collars on her slaves. [They were fucking nasty things](http://usslave.blogspot.com/2011/02/iron-chains-and-collars-on-slaves.html) intended to prevent slaves from running away. The **real** horror here is that those collars were entirely legal in Louisiana during LaLaurie's time. In fact, if you removed the collar against the owner's wishes, you'd face a fine of up to $1,000 (in early 1800s dollars) and up to six months in jail.\n\nThis is not to say that slavery wasn't bad; slavery is a horrific thing. This is just to say that LaLaurie's actions (giving spiked collars, chaining slaves in the kitchen) were standard for the time and place. That's what scares me.\n\nA lot of this is from my own research combing through the first book about the LaLauries, looking through history books about slavery, and living in New Orleans. The evidence has all been out there, but I don't think anyone's put it all together in this way before.\n\ntl;dr Leave LaLaurie alone", "ups": 7, "utctimestamp": 1388773739.0}, {"authorname": "noname", "text": "Wait... so Kathy Bates in AHS is real?!

The highway closely follows the path of the northern B.C. alignment of the Canadian National Railway. The number \"16\" was first given to the highway in 1942, and originally, the route that the highway took was more to the north of today's highway, and it was not as long as it is now. Highway 16 originally ran from New Hazelton east to an obscure location known as Aleza Lake. In 1947, Highway 16's western end was moved from New Hazelton to the coastal city of Prince Rupert, and in 1953, the highway was extended all the way east into Yellowhead Pass. Highway 16's alignment on the Haida Gwaii was commissioned in 1984, with BC Ferries beginning service along Highway 16 to the Haida Gwaii the following year.\n\n---\n\n*I am an experimental bot currently in alpha version.

The priest who was burning him saw him fucking move, only adding to the rumors that he's terrifying. The reason for this is that the priest was inexperienced, and didn't cut the tendons, which when heated caused it to bend, making it look like a body was actually moving.\n\nInterestingly enough, he supposedly cured the Romanov son through hypnotism. The reason that they believed that this worked had something to do with the fact that hemophilia prevents blood from coagulating, but hypnotism (whether effective at convincing people to do things or not) has the ability to relax someone immensely, making their blood flow very slowly.

He managed to overpower his co-pilot and steer the plane North, where he intentionally crashed it into the British RAF base in Gibraltar... The Man himself later explained to me that that pilot had been suffering from a brain tumor which, at that moment, influenced that decision.\n\n The plane was carrying nuclear material, which was spread in the manner of a dirty bomb detonation when the plane's fuel tanks exploded and ignited a large gasoline storage tank in the base, producing a sizeable explosion. This was witnessed by the captain of a United States Forrest-Sherman-Class Destroyer which was headed out of the Mediterranian Sea at the time. Due to the distance, he could not properly ascertain the size of the explosion, but picked up the radiation of the resulting cloud of radioactive material on the ship's Geiger counter, thus making the fatal mistake of confusing the explosion for a nuclear detonation. He seems to have panicked at that point because in his message to Washington, he kept rambling about a Soviet nuclear pre-emptive strike on European military installations along the coast of the mediterranian sea. A lot of people reacted in a very rash manner in the next few hours... Long short story, after the United States started their entire strategic bomber fleet and Russian intelligence got conflicting news of a large-scale exchange between British and Russian forces in the mediterranian (which was entirely fictional and originated from an agent who was at the time suffering from delusions), World War III happened. Half of the human race did not survive the next decade. \n\nThat was the time when The Man appeared. He didn't call himself The Man, but that's what I remember, him being the first Man I had seen in a long time - damn if I can remember what he called himself... He was, that we are quite sure of, not a human being, although he physically resembled one. He talked to me personally at the time (it was 1969), trying to find out what happened to the planet. I distinctly remember him saying that 1969 was a fixed point in time that was about to be altered: A human being had to set foot on the moon on July 20, which was, at the time, impossible because we had effectively bombed ourselves back into the stone ages. The Man implied that it was possible for him to take a human being there, if neccessary, but that that was not how it was supposed to happen. He said that a particular video tape of the moon landing was what was important, one that was longer than it was supposed to be... I can not claim to understand half of it. \n\nThe Man also said that the crash of the B-47 was not a fixed point and could be altered. I would have taken him for just another nutjob then - the human race had not exactly retained its sanity after the war was over. Of course, it was never really over, but the last atomic bomb had been detonated almost eight years ago and there were about a thousand groups claiming to be the United States or the Soviet Union, fighting each other with old rifles, the occasional mortar or landmine, sticks, stones and their bruised fists. \n\nI would have thought The Man was a madman - which was a thing he called himself, by the way - if not for his clothing. In a charred wasteland of endless war, he strolled into my little safehouse in a perfectly new, clean three-piece suit. Now, you can't know what the world was like after the bombs had fallen, but let me tell you: When I saw him entering, I truly thought the suit was a miracle. There was nothing, could be nothing as clean and undamaged in the entire world. \n\nI don't know why I remember it all - because The Man went back. He told me he'd fix things and then he walked out again. There was a noise, then he was gone. Then there was confusion, I lost my consciousness, then I was back in my bed again and the year was 1956, the day after the war had started. Except it hadn't. I called friends and acquaintances everywhere, asked about the bombs, about the Russians and finally about the plane. It turned out that it had disappeared without a trace... They later locked me in a mental ward for a few weeks after I kept telling them about World War III, that was when I learned to shut my mouth. Hell, I stopped believing it myself at some point, started thinking they were right, that I was a right down regular nutcase. \n\nExcept, of course, The Man came back. He looked differently, dressed differently, different face, different hair, different everything, looking younger than before - but it was him alright, and he knew me. Must have been about this time last year, I guess... We had some tea then. Now I know I've always been right, that the War was real and The Man was real, and I'm too old for them to lock me into a madhouse again. They'll just say I'm going a bit senile, so it's alright. I didn't imagine that second visit, either - he left me his number. I call him from time to time.

An affluent family, the Moores were well-known and well-liked in their community.[1] On June 9, 1912, Katherine Moore invited Ina (8) and Lena (12) Stillinger to spend the night at the Moore residence. That evening, the visiting girls and the Moore family attended the Presbyterian church where they participated in the Children's Day Program, which Sarah Moore had coordinated. After the program ended at 9:30 p.m., the Moores and the Stillinger sisters walked to the Moores' house, arriving between 9:45 and 10 p.m.\n\n> At 7 a.m. the next day, Mary Peckham, the Moores' neighbor, became concerned after she noticed that the Moore family had not come out to do their morning chores. Peckham knocked on the Moores' door. When nobody answered, she tried to open the door and discovered that it was locked. Peckham let the Moores' chickens out and then called Ross Moore, Josiah Moore's brother. Like Peckham, Moore received no response when he knocked on the door and shouted. He unlocked the front door with his copy of the house key. While Peckham stood on the porch, Moore went into the parlor and opened the guest bedroom door and found Ina and Lena Stillinger's bodies on the bed. Moore immediately told Peckham to call Hank Horton, Villisca's primary peace officer, who arrived shortly thereafter. Horton's search of the house revealed that the entire Moore family and the two Stillinger girls had been bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon, an ax belonging to Josiah, was found in the guest room where the Stillinger sisters were found.\n\n> Doctors concluded that the murders had taken place between midnight and 5 a.m.[2] The killer or killers began in the master bedroom, where Josiah and Sarah Moore were asleep. Josiah received more blows from the ax than any other victim; his face had been cut so much that his eyes were missing. The killer(s) then went into the children's rooms and bludgeoned Herman, Katherine, Boyd, and Paul in the head in the same manner as their parents. Afterward, the killer(s) moved downstairs to the guest bedroom and killed Ina and Lena.\n\n> Investigators believed that all of the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep at the time of the murders. Investigators also believed Lena attempted to fight back. She was found lying crosswise on the bed, and a defensive wound was discovered on her arm. Furthermore, Lena was found with her nightgown pushed up to her waist and no undergarments on, leading to speculation that the killer(s) sexually molested her or attempted to do so.", "ups": 13, "utctimestamp": 1388755309.0}, {"authorname": "DonQuiHottie", "text": "I came up with my own theory about this (disclaimer: entirely pulled out of my ass with no factual backup whatsoever) when I first read about this case on /r/UnresolvedMysteries (like crack for mystery fans, check it out).\n\nThe daughter Viktoria had been widowed in WWI, if I recall correctly, her husband described as KIA. In WWI, AKA a time when thousands of men were dying daily and it was impossible to keep accurate records. So lets imagine that hubby doesn't die. He is injured, captured or loses his mind, or any combination of the three. For whatever reason (take your pick: disability, poverty, external constraints), it takes him four years to get back home, and for whatever other reason (again, take your pick: he was presumed dead, he was insane, he had been maimed in some way) he hides his arrival from the family and takes refuge in the attic (hence the footsteps and attic noises). He may or may not discover the incestuous relationship between Viktoria and her father whilst he's there. Even if he wasn't already insane, that could drive most people over the edge. For this reason, or for some other reason only he can know (he feels they abandoned him/gave up on him too readily, he is insane) he kills everyone and buggers off into the night, never to be seen again (until tonight, when a flash of lightning illuminates his wrinkled, scar-ridden face outside your bedroom window...just playing).\n\nIt's not watertight but it seems more convincing to me than other explanations I've encountered.\n\nEdit: Prompted by my own post, I've done more reading on the subject. Hubby's body was never found, but apparently consensus online is it's unlikely he's responsible. However whilst learning this I also learnt that Viktoria had slept around quite a bit in the village, and was apparently the first one to be killed. So how about this: village dude sneaks over for fun with Viktoria, they argue, he kills her, panics, lures rest of family in one by one and kills them too, then disappears. \n", "ups": 29, "utctimestamp": 1388743409.0}, {"authorname": "f0rbes1", "text": "Its stories like that which make me turn around and look behind me in my own house.", "ups": 5, "utctimestamp": 1388743301.0}, {"authorname": "noname", "text": "Significant?", "ups": 3, "utctimestamp": 1388756739.0}, {"authorname": "Llaine", "text": "This one is damn creepy when given without all of the context.

It has been proven false since then.\n\nThe story never happened. It's complete fiction.\n\nBut Bernardito, wasn't it included in the Guinness Book of World Records? Doesn't Wikipedia confirm as true?\n\nHere we get to the interesting part. \n\nFirst, the truth: February 1945. It's the final stages of William Slim's brilliant Burma campaign and the British have trapped a Japanese force counting around a thousand men in the islands of Ramree. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese commander chose to take his men across an unblocked route through ten miles of mangrove swamps. Many were already in a bad state entering the swamp. Malaria was rampant. As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through. Out of 900 troops that went into the swamp, 500 made it out. \n\nThe myth: The above story except that by the end 20 troops were captured by the British, the rest were all killed by saltwater crocodiles. This is a 'reported account' from this encounter: *\"That night was the most horrible that any member of the ML crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left... Of about 1,000 Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were left alive.\"*\n\nWhy is this a sensationalist myth?\n\nThe observer of this is according to most accounts a certain [Bruce Wright](http://books.google.se/books/about/Wildlife_Sketches_Near_and_Far.html?id=Kb9XmQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y) who for some reason was in this swamp where this is said to have taken place, sitting in a motor launch and witnessing this. Yet only Wright's *Wildlife Sketches Near and Far* exists as the single account for this to have happened.\n\nThere is no other single source that can verify this event to have happened and the actual survivors themselves that came out of the swamp is enough to disprove this myth. There is no mention of it in official British records and W.O.G. Potts did his own research into this with an incredibly detail investigation in which he interviewed a broad range of people which included Ramree islanders, survivors and soldiers. No one acknowledged that an incident like this had taken place.\n\nLastly, historian Frank McLynn has this to say in his book *The Burma Campaign*: \n\n*Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with a exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).*\n\nThe Wikipedia writer is overly critical about Frank McLynn in the article, for whatever reason that might be. While McLynn did indeed doubt the existence of Mr. Wright but as pointed out in the *Talk* section of the page in question, there is no evidence that the Wright who wrote the book which had the only account of the incident and the Wright which the Wikipedia page uses as a source (a dubious one at that) is the same person. Secondly, the Wikipedia page makes McLynn seem like someone making claims out of thin air which is ridiculous. He's using scholarly sources to back up his claim and is definitely not the only author doubting this story.

The doctor that cared for his mother, a jewish man, was granted immunity to the country of his choosing and was given pass after he had failed to evacuate Germany prior. If you read many of the bios on high profile nazi members you'll be shocked as to what they might have been like as human beings apart from their nazi-esque images. Hitler for example, looked like a hard working young man that sacrificed so much of his life to care for his sick and widowed mother, raise his orphaned siblings or, at minimum, support them...and then he traveled throughout the new German state and the surrounding territories, looking for work and experience, even living amongst the Jewish community in Vienna - growing to appreciate them and their efforts to support their community and rise out of the poverty that many in the city had succumbed to. He began to become passionate about politics and what life ought to be like in order to help the working peoples of nations....soon after he began to grow as a human being WW1 rolls around and he jumps into a Bavarian unit and spends some miserable time in the trenches of Western Europe. He gets back to Germany, a shaken but unchanged man, and is then recruited by a government agency to audit new political parties and groups that are gaining momentum in Germany. One such group he was auditing was spewing so much rhetoric and disgusting philosophy around that he began to rush out of the room angrily, and when stopped and chastised by an official of the group for looking so bitter, he passionately tore into him. Later, the head officials of this group began to contact him and actively pursue such a charismatic and passionate man for the face of the movement...they found him, and worked with him, slowly undermining all of the personal and progressive gains that he had made as a person through out his experiences in life. He did a complete 180 on his philosophies on Nationalism, what he once thought to be a poison, on religion, what he once thought to be the worst weapon the leaders of society could use to undermine the working class [when institutionalized], and began to absolutely abhor the community that had accepted him and helped him through his struggles when he was starving in Vienna...he saw them as a poison that was undermining true Germanic peoples...not as an example that they should follow...but a faction that was only organized and so well put together because they did not truly belong to Germany and thus did not endure her pains. The story is quite sad really, as the rest is history...\n\nBut sometimes, if you look at some of his actions throughout his campaign, beneath his terrible actions, you will see glimmers of the young man that once appeared to be the face of a new, great, progressive Germany...the embodiment of something great to come. Sadly, power corrupts even the greatest of character at times, and desperate men, that once stood naked before the world battling all she threw at them, turn their faces to integrity and loyalty for a new destiny. He absolutely sold his soul and surrendered his individuality because he was sick and tired and saw a way out of his struggle for his friends and family...an easy way. But again, it's just terrifying and depressing to see what he might have tried to do under the radar of his regime...that that young man, that brilliant child, and passionate warrior for a greater humanity was still fighting to gain a foothold on the demon that consumed his mind and body. \n\nNone of this condones what Hitler did...from attempting to destroy an entire people to plunging a world entire war and seeing father's grieve the deaths of their sons, when he was once convinced that the case should always be opposite. It does not mean that he needs the respect of people for who he had been, prior to who he became...in fact the opposite must be true as she showed himself to have no integrity when a decision over his soul came down to a choice at the margin. The case is simply a tragedy, and a reminder to all people, now and again, that we must reign true to our convictions no matter what, as wavering on them, and acting blindly in one direction or the other, might result in catastrophe...that forgoing the rights of other human beings and training yourself to hate their very nature might only lead to bloodlust. If you give into power entirely, whether it be politics, religion, money, or other status...you have become a fool...you can no longer change the world...or at least not for the better. \n\n\nIt sucks, but it is a great reminder, and a sad and horrible tale that is quite true and horrific.

Just curious, I'm just hearing about this case through this thread and I found it very interesting. Looking around, her Tumblr is the only thing still being updated. If you look at [this](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/autre) link and go to her other online profiles, none of them have been updated since her death, and her twitter is deleted. Another Reddit thread linked her [Instagram](http://instagram.com/moulesmariniere), which hasn't been updated either and has a few comments mentioning her death (of course, they could have been posted by random people thinking it was her profile too).\n\nSince the Tumblr is linked to other online accounts that share the same/similar usernames haven't been updated, it does *seem* to be hers. It is weird that it's been updated, though. Since there's only been a handful of posts since February, Euron_Greyjoy's explanation about queuing posts sounds the most plausible. And if you consider that she was supposed to be traveling and probably not updating her blog much, it makes sense that February would have the most amount of queued posts. A couple of the newer posts are of a model named Elisa too, who she had blogged pictures of previously. It wouldn't be too strange for her to have some more in queue. The only other thing I can think of is that Tumblr users can re-use usernames of deleted blogs, however, I don't think that's the case here as her entire archive would be gone as well.\n\n... As I typed this up I noticed a couple other things. Her [March 2011 archive](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/archive/2011/3) has some photographs that seem to be the owner of the Tumblr. [This](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/3618147883) one would probably be best for comparison as it shows her face, although if it was her, it's a couple years old, and is impossible to compare to the video at least. There is also a [blog post](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/41786151020/i-have-arrived-in-laland-and-there-is-a) about her being in LA. The more I look through the blog, the more I think you weren't wrong in saying that is was hers.\n\nETA - Okay, now I'm almost positive the most recent posts were queued. If you look at who she reblogged them from, they were posted before her death. For example, [this](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/46831796200/confusedtree-flightfoot-is-this-a-zelda) video was reblogged from \"lampfaced,\" who posted it on January 13, 2013. The most recent post with the lighbulb was reblogged from [here](http://berezy.tumblr.com/post/40385454895/skeletales-by-alessandro-gottardo), which says it was posted \"11 mois\" ago.

And a local man came up and said that I had killed his son. And he placed a rifle barrel right between my eyes and he was going to shoot me. But fortunately, the guards chased him away. ZAHN: Kinnel was tied to two different trees for as long as 14 hours at a time.\n\nKINNEL: I realized how lucky I was to have survived the eight days that I was here. \n\nIt seemed like almost yesterday that -- that it all happened. \n\nZAHN: He would be the last American to leave the island alive.

Ridiculous, they didn't consider the Geneva Convention. When the emperor declared war on the United States, he specifically left out any mention of honoring international agreements.\n\nZAHN: Without international protections, Japanese officers on Chichijima, like Major Suo (ph) Matoba were able to commit crimes so horrible, they hadn't even been specifically outlawed in the rules of war.\n\nBRADLEY: And in this guy's twisted, brutal mind, the Japanese spirit could be fed, could be heightened by the killing of American POWs. And then subsequently, actually consuming their livers in terms of getting the spirit out of the enemy.\n\nZAHN: By the war's end, eight flyers had been killed on Chichijima, most by beheading. After many executions, a Japanese doctor was brought in.\n\nBRADLEY: The doctors had to cut open the American on the orders of an officer, even though they found it very objectionable and did not want to perform this type of thing.\n\nZAHN: Matoba was most interested in the Americans' livers.\n\nBRADLEY: He would have these livers prepared and cut up into tiny bits. You really didn't know what the meat was. And he would serve it at parties, and serve it onto other officers who were eating it unknowingly. \n\nZAHN: After Japan's surrender, Matoba faced capital charges at a war crimes trial on Guam.\n\nBRADLEY: Immediately at the end of the war, he asked everyone to cover up. He was embarrassed by his behavior. And he apologized in the course of the trial, but the facts were the facts, and he was hung.

You can literally use any part of the tree to get high; the root, the flower, the fruit, etc. This tree grows everywhere in Colombia. It grow in their national parks, in the middle of cities and it's actually a really common tree. The most potent part is the seeds and they are often extracted for the processing of Scopolamine.  \n    \nThere are some similarities between this drug and cocaine. For starters, you need to chemically alter the originally plant to make the drug. Secondly, they have the same look, weight and density. How is it different? Other than just about everything chemically, **a gram of Scopolamine has the toxicity to kill a dozen grown men.**  \n    \nIn the documentary, they meet with a drug dealer who knows a lot of the drug and where to get it; it's actually quite hard to obtain because of how delicate and dangerous it is. Airborne particles of the drug are enough to put you under it's influence. What happens when you are under the influence? Experts have compared it to \"chemical hypnosis\". You are completely open to suggestion and will want to help people rob you or help them with whatever it is that they want. The whole time you are on the drug, you appear to be coherent and sober, thus making it hard to know that someone is under it's influence and protect them from it.  \n    \nIt was even used by ancient societies when a king died and would be given to his mistresses so that they would voluntarily join him in his tomb.  \n    \nThe natural form isn't too friendly either. The drug dealer talked about doing Datura (the natural form) by eating 1 1/2 of the fruits with a friend and he tripped **for 17 days**. His friend did more and, partially, is permanently stuck in the trip.  \n    \nTL;DR - Scopolamine is a drug that has only criminal use. It is used to rob, rape or kill.

South Koreans are so close, yet so disconnected from the entire situation. North Koreans are their OWN PEOPLE! These are Koreans being tortured, starved, killed, and who knows what. Yes, I realize that we are all people, so it should not make a difference if they are Korean or not. Humans are suffering, and that is the main point. Regardless, for some reason as an American,  I personally feel more connected to a story when I hear that Americans were involved. I don't know why that's the case, but it's true.

Even now, if you google Lam Elisa instead of Elisa Lam, most of the results deal with TB. The similarity would be fairly easy to discover. \n\nNow, TB. Tuberculosis is not that rare. There are a few thousand cases in California every single year (down to ~2,200 in 2012 from ~5,400 in 1992). [Here's a PDF report](http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/tb/Documents/TBCB_Report_2012.pdf) from the California Department of Public Health. \n\nBased on that table, you can see the LA has a significant percent of the TB cases. There are a few reasons for this. LA is the most populated city in California and TB is more common in overcrowded areas. People who use drugs, have weakened immune systems, live in poverty, and have a poor diet are more likely to develop TB after being exposed to the bacteria. In other words, the hotel itself would be a perfect place for TB to spread, and it's not surprising it happened in the same general area. \n\nThe fact that an outbreak happened a block away within a few weeks makes sense by the numbers. LA had more than 600 cases of TB in 2012. If a TB outbreak happened five blocks away two weeks earlier, people would read into that. Or if it happened a month later and three blocks away. \n\nThe thing is that LA would continue to have TB outbreaks in the hotel area if Lam never visited, and she would always share her name with the test. It's only 'significant' because of where she died. It would also be 'significant' if she died of TB or she became an infectious disease specialist or robbed a hospital with TB kits or whatever. \n\nTo me, the only crazy coincidence is that she shared her exact name with the test, not that she was sort of close to a TB outbreak.

Did God create everything that exists?  A student bravely replied, \"Yes, he did!\"\n\n>\"God created everything? The professor asked. \n\n>\"Yes sir\", the student replied. \n\n>The professor answered, \"If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil\". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.\n\n>Another student raised his hand and said, \"Can I ask you a question professor?\" \n\n>\"Of course\", replied the professor. \n\n>The student stood up and asked, \"Professor, does cold exist?\" \n\n>\"What kind of question is this?  Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?\" The students snickered at the young man's question.\n\n>The young man replied, \"In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat.\"\n\n>The student continued, \"Professor, does darkness exist?\"  \n\n>The professor responded, \"Of course it does.\"\n\n>The student replied, \"Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is?  You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present.\"\n\n>Finally the young man asked the professor, \"Sir, does evil exist?\"  \n\n>Now uncertain, the professor responded, \"Of course as I have already said. We see it every day.  It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil.\"\n\n>To this the student replied, \"Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.\"\n\n>The professor sat down.\n\n>The young man's name \u2014 Albert Einstein.", "ups": 38, "utctimestamp": 1388742830.0}, {"authorname": "MrArtless", "text": "Thank you!", "ups": 0, "utctimestamp": 1388741365.0}, {"authorname": "LeonardPeikoff", "text": "That whole book is horrific.

It is used to rob, rape or kill. It is so potent, that airborne particles can put you under its influence. While under the influence you will listen to anyone's suggestions, you may even go out of your way to help them. To outsiders, it is almost impossible to tell that someone is on Scopolamine.\n\nYour TL;DR is misleading, especially saying that it has only criminal use. Source, RN. Allow me to explain. \n\nThis drug is a muscarinic antagonist. So, its similar to atropine. My source for this information is Pharmacology for Nursing Care, by Richard A. Lehne. Sixth Edition. \n\nMuscarinic antagonists as a class of drug block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, the majority of which are found on structures innervated by parasympathetic nerves. So, when you block these nerves you are essentially blocking the effects of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). The normal effects of the PSNS are 'rest and digest'. It constricts the pupils, increases blood flow to GI tract, shunts blood away from skeletal muscle, increases smooth muscle contraction in the GI tract, decreases heart rate etc. You could think of it as the opposite of the Fight or Flight response, which is what the Sympathetic Nervous System does. (Not certain your level of education, so to be fair, this is being boiled down quite a bit, you could have a PhD in something for all I know.) However, blocking the PSNS does not necessarily mean that the person will exhibit a sympathetic, or Fight or Flight, response. \n\npp 129\nScopolamine is an anticholinergic drug antagonist with actions much like those of atropine, but with two exceptions. 1) ...therapeutic doses of atropine produce mild CNS (central nervous system) excitation (agitation etc), therapeutic doses of Scopolamine produce sedation. 2) Scopolamine suppresses emesis (vomiting) and motion sickness, whereas Atropine does not. \n\nScopolamine is also used for production of preanesthetic sedation and obstetric amnesia. However this is a different dose. It is used to prevent profound bradycardia, as well as to dry up respiratory secretions. (To be fair, I am not a CRNA, but I believe Atropine is used more commonly). It is however, also used for post-operative nausea and vomiting. However, in my time in the PACU, I never used it, I only ever saw decadron and other medications used for this. So I believe it is uncommonly used for this.\n\nSo to say that it has no use apart from criminal is incorrect. \n\nThis medication is very commonly prescribed for nausea, vomiting, motion sickness etc. Especially outside of the US, where it is known sometimes as Buscopan. \n\nIn your defense however, it can be abused, much like any drug. In the event that someone was given a very high dose of this medication however, it can cause delirium and symptoms of psychosis. It has been used in the past for purposes of interrogation. \n\nI doubt that people under the influence of this drug act normally to the point where it is impossible to tell if someone is under the influence of the medication. However, this is in the realm of controlled production of it, so its possible the non-controlled version mentioned in the video is different, though I suspect they mix it with something else. \n\n\n", "ups": 2, "utctimestamp": 1389492711.0}, {"authorname": "king_m1k3", "text": "If I remember the VICE documentary I saw, it's a powder and you can just blow it in someones face and they will become completely complacent in anything you say and will have no recollection of it later.", "ups": 6, "utctimestamp": 1388748764.0}, {"authorname": "ImAnAlbatross", "text": "that is definitely one way to sugarcoat it", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388775960.0}, {"authorname": "sweet_peas", "text": "Not to mention that most other homosapiens were wiped out 70,000 -50,000 years ago after a giant volcanic eruption, and the resultant ice age whittled the population down to some 10,000 individual breeding pairs.

The ballistics are explained much better (basically perfectly) if the shot came from the agent riding behind him. One thing that makes the ballistics funky in general is that JFK's seats in the car weren't at the same height as the row that the Texas gov. was sitting in (I think JFK's were lower, kind of like the interior of the car was scooped out). \n\nI would say that the second bullet doesn't really have an exit wound per se, only because it resulted in about a quarter of his skull blowing off. This is actually one of the facts that never lined up all that well with the official report; the first bullet (the one traditionally called \"the magic bullet\") traveled through JFK's neck, the car seats, and then the Texas governor's back and front before finally lodging in his wrist, which it shattered. This pass-through trajectory is consistent with a full metal jacket type of bullet. The fatal shot, however, was more like a hollow point bullet, which expands/explodes on impact. \n\nIt's obviously not impossible that LHO used totally different rounds in his rifle, but it seems a little off. The agent in the car behind JFK, however, was seen sweeping an AR-15 (which had just been introduced into the Secret Service's arsenal) in the immediate aftermath of the first shot, a weapon that was loaded with hollow points. \n\nAdditionally, x-rays of the President's brain showed tens of small objects arrayed around the entry wound of the second shot consistent with the fragments of a hollow point bullet. These were confiscated by the Secret Service (with a promise that they'd be returned after the Agency made copies) but never seen again. There are several other factual or circumstantial oddities that convincingly (IMO) begin to make sense if you operate from the assumption that JFK was accidentally shot by an agent in the car behind him (I can go into those a bit if you'd like btw).\n\nIn a less specific way, I find this explanation to be very tidy for everything that happened. Like, yes, there was a big cover-up, but there was no preexisting conspiracy or shadowy cabal. It was the Secret Service covering up a horrible and tragic mistake, and there's so much crap that's just plain weird (like, where is his brain?!?!) because they were flying by the seat of their pants. Jack Ruby was just a nutcase. LHO didn't follow up one great shot with a second impossibly great shot. Then it was pretty much \"in for a penny, in for a pound,\" we have a dead shooter, case closed.

It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins, etc.), but exists in a weaker version in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. Every animal's diving reflex is triggered specifically by cold water contacting the face \u2013 water that is warmer than 21 \u00b0C (70\u00b0F) does not cause the reflex, and neither does submersion of body parts other than the face.

The Iron Curtain was put up because the Communist parties of Eastern Europe were imposed by and modeled after the USSR. Even when the Communists [attempted to take over Germany in 1919](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution), they attempted to implement [a different form of Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourgism) than the Marxist-Leninism of the USSR.\n\nFurthermore, in the one country of Europe where Communism wasn't imposed but arose independently, in Yugoslavia, It was a much more [liberal and market-friendly form of Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titoism) and actually led to conflict between [Tito and Stalin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_split). Communists weren't some sort of hivemind that believed in totalitarianism for the sake of totalitarianism, they had tons of disagreements and many of them were killed by other Communists for it. \n\n>the UK also suffers economically and undergoes a communist revolution. Since the entire developed world has gone Communist, support for Communism builds in the US, and the result is a reactionary police-state. The entire world becomes totalitarian.\n\nI don't know why you would assume this, [Oswald Mosely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosely) and the Fascists were pretty powerful in Britain, as were [Fascist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falange) [movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrofascism) [in the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_of_August_Regime) [rest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e) [of Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetniks). Although I think it is likely that the non-Communist regimes would become more reactionary (they were already pretty hostile to the movement, and [had been since the Russian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War) and Civil War), there's no way of knowing if they would go towards Communism or Fascism, or even remain Liberal democracies. \n\n>It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades.\n\nNot really, the [\"Drive towards the East\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drang_nach_Osten) had been part of German nationalist ideology since the 19th Century. Hitler wasn't the first who looked East for Lebensraum, just the most ambitious. There's no reason to believe the Nazi party would just drop [one it's key platform points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum) just because Hitler is dead. Whoever the new leader is, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Bormann, Hess or whoever, they would all want to expand Germany's borders East.

Like you i have made this travel. You theroy is interessting but wrong at a crucial point. Facism wasnt a bigger thing in prenazi germany than it is now. Only Hitler/the NSDAP made is so popular. The facsim movement was very weak and small and only ganined influence because of the charismatic and brillant rethorical speaker Hitler was.\n\nHere is what what happened if you would kill Hitler early enough:\n\nLets assume you have one chance to go back in time and you choose to bomb Hitler at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus at the 24. February 1920 where he would held his first important speech infront of 2000 people. You choose this point in time because Hitler hasnt done anything yet but you still want to blow up as many early nazis as possible. So you blow him up.\n\n Bang.\n\nGreat. Is it? Well... This doesnt change much for europe. You killed a guy and some of his racist party friends. But the social unrests in germany proceed to result. Another person, wich equal rhetorical skills and charisma will apear. We will call him Argos, just for the fun of it. He gets elected the same way Hitler got elected but he will do this on a different political platform. But WW2 will still happen but the holocaust does not.\n\nArgos is the contrary to Hitler. He is not insane.(Well he is, but in a much more dangerous and controlled way.) Hes not megalomaniac and he is a brillant strategist who will listen to his Generals. (Which are still the same Hitler got.) The German forces are now much stronger because of this. Argos could form a mighty german army where religons doesnt matter. He forms his army after napoleonic morals which makes his army superior to any army in the world, by moral, education and technical advantages. Still he kills all and everything that thinks otherwise to his party believes. There is only one Argos.\n\nArgos expands into poland and fortifies his position instead of continuing to expand into the East. Same as Hitler, Argos takes in a Blitzkrieg fashion the Benelux, France and kills all the British Soldiers at Dunkirk, leaving Britain shattered. But then he stops. He plays the political game and stabilises the geopolitical situation for now. Now, not only are the german forces much much stronger, but most of the german intellectual elite has never left the country. In fact noone defected because Argos gives them all the Resources they need and scientists do what they do best under such conditions. They invent and build. Van Brown works in Pennem\u00fcnde, without all the hassle the nazis gave him, on long distance rockets. Einstein, while not a fan of Argos and outspoken against the war, never had a reason to flee the country. He keeps working in Berlin.\n\nThe german counterpart of the \"Manhatten Project\", the German nuclear energy project, short the Uranium Club, is Argos pet project. The Uranium Club is therefore much faster in their research, because all the physicists, engineers, and mathematicians who were driven out of Germany by Hitler as early as 1933 are still there and working as hard as they can for Argos. Also the USA doesnt have much time to look closely at Europe because they are focused on the Japanese Movement and the developments in the Pacific Area. Germany develops the atom bomb.\n\nA german nuke carried by the japanese fleet hits Peral Harbor in a preemptive strike. Argos forces the surrender of all major nations on the continent after decimating every other capitol city with nuclear weapons. Europe becomes a single nation headed by a dictator. Building an entire eastern Powerbloc and threatening the rest of the world.

The branches on the tree were broken up to five meters high, suggesting that a skier had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp.

These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. No precise value has been proposed for Dunbar's number. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 230, with a commonly used value of 150. Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on long-term memory size.\n\n---\n\n ^[(?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| ^[(CC)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)", "ups": 2, "utctimestamp": 1388773260.0}, {"authorname": "gamegeek1995", "text": "I have heard passing details about the first two, never the third, but nothing truly in-depth about any of them.\n\nSeriously, humans are fucking brutal things.

The German economy itself wasn't producing consumer goods, generally, and especially not for export. Most of its industrial capabilities in the 30's were going directly towards rearmament.\n\nFirst off, unemployment numbers were fudged. The Nazis removed women from unemployment numbers (they were counted under the Weimar Republic). They also removed Jews in 1935 (as they lost citizenship) and if you were unemployed, you either accepted government-paid labor (the vast majority of projects were not useful public works, unlike in the US) or you were sent to a Concentration Camp. They also enacted conscription as part of rearmament, which also reduced the number. So, yes, he reduced unemployment. Not in an economically healthy manner. Germany's military expenditures until 1938 (I don't have data thereafter) were 10% of their GDP, but that's only counting IMMEDIATE military expenditures, not all the other stuff they were doing that had military applications.\n\nDebt-wise, Germany had a debt of 40 billion Reichsmarks in 1939, and their balance of trade was RM (100 million). Their annual income was RM 15 billion, and their deficit was over RM 15 billion (> 30 billion expenditure). IIRC, their GDP in 1939 was roughly RM 180 billion (or 129, having trouble finding sources). \n\nThis differs from Roosevelt in that the New Deal was explicitly building infrastructure -- the US was trading debt for growth. Germany was trading debt for weapons. Germany was *reliant* on taking other countries' hard currency to fuel their growth - the first thing that happened after marching into Bohemia was all currency reserves were taken.

Short summary of events:\n\n* 9 of them left the tent without being fully dressed and made it ~1km downhill to the safe place. In that time, one of them was apparently lost and eventually died. He was later discovered to have blunt skull trauma at this point.\n\n* The remaining 8 started to collect wood and make fire. Eventually two of them went back to the tent and died from hypothermia on the way, one earlier, another one later.\n\nSo far this suggests really bad weather, but skull trauma? Wtf. This calls for actual avalanche, but apparently there was none. Others had no injuries at this point, and the stuff in the tent was later found intact. The photos from eariler in that tent show no signs that any of them had injuries.\n\n* The remaining 6 made fire but it didn't help. Two more of them were found dead at the site of the fire. Corpses were slightly burnt where they were lying close to the fire, which means the fire was still burning after their death.\n\nBy this time I'm wondering just what kind of extreme weather it was that 5 top class hikers died in like 45 minutes by simply being outside. They weren't wet, they were mostly dressed - not completely, but they certainly weren't nude.\n\n* The 4 survivors made a snow burrow to hide from the wind. They hid there and still were found dead. They didn't die of hypothermia: instead, all of them died from crushed ribs and skulls, and these injuries supposedly happened after they left the tent (experts said they would not be able to walk for long with them). This probably means their burrow came down on them.\n\nSo there's at least four mysteries here, not counting the radiation: 1. Just what kind of weather it was? Weather data from that time did not indicate anything particularly disastrous, 2. What happened that they left the tent? There probably was no avalanche, could have been a fear of avalanche, but why injuries? 3. What happened in the burrow? 4. Why top class hikers failed so utterly in saving their lives?\n\nSure, all of this can kinda sorta be explained by various bad luck but it's not so simple as cracked paints it to be.

This makes him a strategist and schemer who prefers to use misdirection to accomplish most of his goals.\n\n**Thor**\n\nAt the start of the movie Thor is an arrogant, incompetent, impulsive prick.  He is also set to take the throne of Asgard at a time the Frost giants are getting uppity; as proven by their willingness to launch an attempt to reclaim their most powerful weapon from the Asgardians.\n\nLoki realizes that shit is about to go sideways, in a big way, as soon as Odin goes down for his nap.  Loki needs to neutralize the threat his brother and the frost giants represent to Asgard.  He manipulates the Frost Giants into infiltrating Asgard, thus reminding all Asgardians of the threat the FG represent.  He then manipulates Thor into launching an ill-conceived reprisal against the FG, demonstrating that Thor is unfit to lead Asgard through the coming crisis.  Odin responds by exiling Thor.\n\nWith Thor out of the way, Loki then convinces the FGs' leader to attempt to personally assassinate Odin.  He \"catches\" the FGs in the act and kills their leader.  With the assassination attempt as justification, he then launches an all out assault on the FGs using the Rainbow Bridge as a death ray.\n\nIf things had gone *exactly* as Loki planned Thor would simply have languished in exile, while the FGs got decimated as an example to any other potential trouble makers.  The cosmos would have realized that you do not screw around while King Loki is on the throne, and peace would have reigned throughout the Nine Realms.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone, the traitorous \"Warriors Three\", in direct violation of a royal edict, sneak down to Earth to convince Thor to return and usurp the Throne.  At that point Thor and his friends have become a threat to cosmic security, and Loki has no choice but to unleash The Destroyer in an attempt to neutralize them.  Tragically this has the unforeseeable side effect of Thor regaining his powers and returning to Asgard.  \n\nThor, genius that he is, decides he has to save the FGs from his brother's 'evil schemes'.  He accomplishes this by *smashing his own people's strategic transportation infrastructure*.  In an act of truly God-Tier stupidity he spares the FGs the worst of the devastation Loki had planned for them, while simultaneously immobilizing Asgard's armies.  \n\nWe later find out (in Thor 2) that a direct consequence of his actions is chaos throughout the nine realms which ultimately required an extensive military campaign to resolve.  Thor is hailed as a hero for leading said campaign, despite the fact that he was a major cause of the problems.  **All of which would have been avoided if everyone had just done what Loki told them to do.**\n\nAt the end of Thor, Loki slips away into the wider universe.  Realizing that Asgard's armies are trapped in Asgard, he alone will be free to act to protect the interests of his adopted people.  Pretty quickly he concludes that the Tesseract, a source of limitless energy which is capable of transporting armies across the cosmos, is not safe in the hands of humanity.  We can't control it.  We can't protect it.  And we're using it to make weapons of mass destruction.  However, returning the Tesseract to Odin would both keep it safe and restore mobility to Asgard's forces. \n\nCue The Avengers.", "ups": 36, "utctimestamp": 1388768849.0}, {"authorname": "TehGinjaNinja", "text": "I did,\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1uac3m/reddit_what_is_the_creepiest_true_event_in/cege46c\n\nand \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1uac3m/reddit_what_is_the_creepiest_true_event_in/cegfp2i\n\n", "ups": 5, "utctimestamp": 1388772492.0}, {"authorname": "S133py", "text": "It was Obi Wan's presence he sensed", "ups": 10, "utctimestamp": 1388766363.0}, {"authorname": "akpak", "text": "\"The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master\" (ObiWan)\n\nAnakin was never in the presence of his kids as children.", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388778367.0}, {"authorname": "PerfectLogic", "text": "Because, by then, he had engaged Luke in combat and felt the dark side possibilities in him with his outbursts of anger.

He needs to get the Tesseract from Earth to Asgard, but he's got little to work with other than some magic and his own considerable wits.  Unfortunately, Thanos, a well known cosmic ne're-do-well has learned of the Tesseract's location on Earth.\n\nLoki decides to do what he does best, offer his the enemies of Asgard a deal, just so he can stab them in the back.  He approaches Thanos and promises to get him the Tesseract in exchange for weapons, troops, and ownership of the Earth.  This accomplishes two things, it provides Loki with the material resources he needs to take the Tesseract away from the ignorant humans who are fiddling with it, and it keeps Thanos from launching a more effective operation on his own.\n\nPrior to contacting Thanos, Loki likely conducted a strategic assessment of Earth forces.  It becomes clear through the events of the movie that he knew about all of shield's assets, he knew about the hulk, and he knew about Iron Man.  It also becomes clear that he deliberately under-reports the strength of Earth's forces to Thanos, whose henchman even states, \"The humans were not the weaklings we had been lead to believe.\"\n\nAs the movie unfolds, Loki deliberately baits all of the heroes into action.  He kidnaps and brainwashes Hawkeye, ensuring both Hawkeye and Black widow will be personally invested in the final fight.  He starts stomping around Europe and pontificating like a wanna-be dictator, which ensures Captain America will want a piece of the action (\"The last time I saw a man standing above everyone else, we had a disagreement.\").  \n\nHe uses the scepter to trigger Banner's transforming into the Hulk.  He sets up shop *on top of Stark Tower*.  We know from Thor that he can hide from Baldur's magic omni-vision, but somehow Odin still learns what he's up to and sends Thor down to Earth to retrieve him.  \n\nLoki is a master manipulator; none of this is coincidence or accident.  Despite having a history of stealthy actions and indirect scheming, he spends the whole movie putting on a show.  Stark even calls him a \"full-tilt diva\" and refers to the final fight as \"opening night\".  Loki does everything he can to bring the team together, short of shouting \"Avengers Assemble\"!\n\nFinally, think about what Loki brings to the Battle of New York.  The worm-hole he opens with the Tesseract is too small to function as anything other than a strategic bottle neck.  At most, a couple of hundred Chitauri make it through, and those aren't very impressive.  \n\nI mean, come on, Hawkeye manages kill dozens with a freaking *bow and arrows*.  Sure, he's a 'superhero', but his superpower is basically just being really good in combat.  Think about it for a moment and you'll realize, Earth's conventional military forces would have made minced-meat out of the Chitauri as soon as they arrived on scene.  \n\nWorst case scenario (which almost happened), the Avengers fail and someone nukes NY.  Even that would have sent a strong deterrent message, to anyone from another planet, thinking of conquering the Earth.  Loki would have just dug the Tesseract out of the rubble, and used it to return to Asgard.  \n\nThen at the end, Loki is beaten and surrenders.  This guy can turn invisible and create whole armies of illusory copies of himself.  He could have snuck away if he wanted too.  He doesn't, because for him it's \"mission accomplished\".  He's going home with the Tesseract, and that's what he wanted from the start.\n\nIn the final analysis, the outcome of Loi's actions are dozens (maybe hundreds) dead in NY, and a crap load of property damage.  However, Earth and Asgard are both safer than if Loki had done nothing.  Again, that's not a coincidence or an accident.  \n\nAnd it's not just Earth and Asgard.  Thanos is a genocidal maniac.  There is no telling how much damage he could have done if he had gotten his hands on the Tesseract.  **Loki saved countless worlds, and did it while playing the villain.  He did it, expecting no thanks or reward.  He did it, just because it needed to be done.  That's real heroism, and it's head and shoulders above Thor's accomplishments.**", "ups": 32, "utctimestamp": 1388772425.0}, {"authorname": "PerfectLogic", "text": "Holy shit. That's amazing.

Hitler was not against international socialism because of the economic theory of international socialism. Hitler was against international socialism because of its internationalist nature and that it claimed all races are equal (pretty much the only thing communism got right). Hitler believed that Germans (arians) are racially superior to other \"races\". This was the primary reason Hitler was against communism. He had no problem with the economic theory of communism.\n\n2.) Why would someone who bases his party's *foundation* on anti-socialism call his party *\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\"* - don't you find this just a little bit weird?\n\n>That Nazism is the reaction against the Marxists who want to remove the existence of private property and that one of the core tenets of Nazism is the defense of private property?\n\nIndeed, fascism was a reaction to Marxism, that's perfectly clear. But not because of capitalism vs. communism, as in the economic theory, but because of the fact that as said above, communism was an internationalist movement while fascists claimed that the particular ethnic group they belonged to was superior to others. It was the race thing that set them apart and not the economic thing.\n\nThe thing about private property: Private property only exists if no outside force can confiscate it for whatever reason. Nazism, like communism, is a collectivist ideology that states that the individual can be sacrificed for the good of the group. i.e. if confiscating your property by force and at your expense is deemed to be beneficial for a larger group of people then it's perfectly justified. Nazis had no problem with this, they just didn't went as far as the communists but they came pretty close.\n\nJust ask the jews (and any other persons/groups that the ruling party didn't like for whatever arbitrary reasons) how their private property was defended. This is also how it began in communism: First only the property of the state's \"enemies\" was confiscated, eventually it happened to everyone.\n\n>Why did Hitler gain the support of conservative politicians who even made him part of the government, why didn't the communists gain the support of conservative politicians? \n\nBecause the conservative politicians, like Hitler, were nationalists and believed in the supremacy of Germany and wanted to revenge Germany's defeat in the previous war. Communists, on the other hand, were internationalists and didn't care if Germany as a country lost or won, as they didn't really care about any other arbitrarily drawn lines on the map either.\n\n>Why did Hitler gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany, why didn't the communists gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany?\n\nBecause under Nazism those capitalists were de facto made part of the government. Their factories basically supplied all the goods and services needed for the German war machine. Those companies completely depended on the government and had the government as their main client. \n\nHowever, they weren't really private companies de facto, as it wasn't like they could do whatever they want. They still had to execute whatever the party told them to execute and produce whatever the party told them to produce. They were basically an unofficial branch of the government.\n\nIn other words, they were de jure privately owned companies however de facto they were state controlled and centrally commanded businesses. From here it just takes one step towards communism. The economy of Nazi Germany was as far as it could get from free market capitalism.\n\nYou can like it or not, fascism and Nazism aren't the polar opposites to communism. They are obviously not the same however they aren't as far away from each other as one might think.

They were people who stole the word socialist. Note that at the time and today, the definition of socialism was basically 'a revolutionary against the capitalist institution of private property'. Wanting to change the meaning of socialism from 'against private property' to 'being nationalist and for private property' is a pretty big change, don't you agree?\n\nAt the time in Germany, socialism was immensely popular. The number one political party was the conservative party. The number two was often the communist party. Calling yourself socialist was a PR move, just like using the color red and appropriating other words used by socialists and communists. The clearest case of this was the Spanish fascist party the Falange, where they simply said: \"the anarchist flag was red and black, we wanted ours to be similar.\"\n\nSo again to be clear, 'stealing' symbols used by leftists was one of the strategies fascists used. Even if the ideologies sharply contrast.\n\nYour knowledge of German's history is lacking. Why did the predecessor of the Germany Nazi party fought against German communists in the Rhineland to defend private property during the German revolution?\n\nYour justification for saying that communism and fascism are the same is that both the fascist ideology and Soviet Communism had the state take action. So is the US fascist as well? The US state confiscates property all the time. In times of war the US confiscates money belonging to parties it deems to be the enemy. It also tells weapon manufacturers that they are not allowed to sell their property to certain groups. Is this evidence of the US being anti-capitalist? Your definition of socialism basically being 'state intervention' is misplaced. Every capitalist society relies on state intervention. It is weird to say a society is not capitalist because it has state intervention.\n\nEven the rise of capitalism as an economical system was paired with an extreme amount of state violence under direction of the capitalists as a class. Is the rise of capitalism socialist? Were the capitalists who directed this violence both owners of capital and socialist? If that is your definition of socialism, then you've defined socialism as something that runs completely contrary to any meaningful definition, the history of socialism, and the definition of socialism used by socialists.\n\nYour answer to my question about why Hitler was supported by conservatives is pretty weak. Simply by being a nationalist you are given an important position in the government? Why didn't all of the other nationalists get invited to join the government?\n\nFascists generally had the support of the army, right-wing paramilitary groups, conservative politicians, religious institutions, monarchists, and the richest capitalists. They were reactionary, anti-leftist, specifically anti-communist, anti-intellectual, racist, pro-private property, and nationalist. Socialists generally had the support of unions, workers, racial minorities, and some intellectuals. They were revolutionary, anti-capitalist, anti-conservative, anti-racist, and anti-nationalist.\n\nSomehow you seem to think that these are the same. I think it comes down to you not liking both, so that's why they are the same. The rest is justifying for yourself why you believe that to be the case, ignoring that they are polar opposites.", "ups": 3, "utctimestamp": 1388807310.0}, {"authorname": "noname", "text": "Battlestar Galactica would have ended with a more substantial ending than \"God did it\".", "ups": 8, "utctimestamp": 1388743728.0}, {"authorname": "exgiexpcv", "text": "Wash and Shepherd Book would still be alive!  \n\nDAMN YOU, HITLER!!!", "ups": 6, "utctimestamp": 1388751408.0}, {"authorname": "GourryGabriev", "text": "Or Freaks and Geeks", "ups": 3, "utctimestamp": 1388750251.0}, {"authorname": "Thisonework", "text": "Teen Titans would still be great", "ups": 3, "utctimestamp": 1388759780.0}, {"authorname": "sneezlehose", "text": "Kel wouldn't have dropped the screw in the tuna.", "ups": 3, "utctimestamp": 1388762710.0}, {"authorname": "blackhelium", "text": "The Vikings would win a Superbowl ", "ups": 2, "utctimestamp": 1388760685.0}, {"authorname": "1jimbo", "text": "OJ Simpson wouldn't have been a murderer...", "ups": 2, "utctimestamp": 1388814864.0}, {"authorname": "Wanz75", "text": "The McRib would be a permanent menu item.", "ups": 2, "utctimestamp": 1389126435.0}, {"authorname": "blacknred522", "text": "We could find out what happened after promise city in the 4400", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388758490.0}, {"authorname": "noname", "text": "Prison break wouldn't go down the shitter after the second season.", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388763752.0}, {"authorname": "whalefister", "text": "I would have had two penises", "ups": 1, "utctimestamp": 1388773163.0}, {"authorname": "headpool182", "text": "Or undeclared.", "ups": 0, "utctimestamp": 1388749765.0}, {"authorname": "Ilmarinen_tale2", "text": "There would've been three Last Airbender Movies, and they would've been perfect.", "ups": 321, "utctimestamp": 1388737565.0}, {"authorname": "Magdiesel94", "text": "/r/laogai ", "ups": 14, "utctimestamp": 1388738430.0}, {"authorname": "kragmoor", "text": "If there's any circle jerk I can't wait to implode in on itself like a neutron star, it's this one", "ups": 5, "utctimestamp": 1388743313.0}, {"authorname": "noname", "text": "Oh good.
