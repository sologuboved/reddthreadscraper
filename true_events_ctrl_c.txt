The story of Delphine LaLaurie is still one of the most horrifying and unnerving things that comes to mind when we're talking about shit that actually happened.

She was a socialite in Louisiana who tortured and maimed her slaves. One day a house fire was started by one of her slave cooks who she had chained to a stove. The slave later said she started the fire as a way to kill herself. When police entered the house following the fire, they found slaves who were maimed due to all kinds of fucked up experiments LaLaurie had been doing on them. People had their limbs removed and re-attached and stuff like that. Reportedly, some of them even begged to be killed.

She was never caught.

Actually, she was simply 'permitted to leave'. She had maltreated her livestock and was within her rights. Which is why slavery is so vile.

People had their limbs removed and re-attached

This strains credulity. removing and reattaching limbs is not something you can do without serious knowhow and training. Even trained doctors at the time weren't really able to do it, heck we STILL aren't that good at it.

[–]uncanny_valley_girl 64 points 4 years ago

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]MeloJelo 10 points 4 years ago 
Yeah, I imagine it'd be pretty easy to do it, the limb just wouldn't function and would probably die and start rotting.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]DuosTesticulosHabet 16 points 4 years ago 
Just so I understand better, are you talking about removing limbs and reattaching them so that they're still functional? Or just removing the limbs in general?

Because from my understanding, she was just removing the limbs and stitching them back onto the body in some insane way. It seems like that would be way more doable as long as the slave didn't die during the amputation.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]UnknownQTY 10 points 4 years ago 
Oh absolutely, but getting a blood supply to those limbs with no medical training? The implications of the stories about 'crab people' implies they were somewhat functional and not rotting appendages just sewn on.

Darya Nikolayevna Saltykova (Russian: Дарья Николаевна Салтыкова; née Ivanova, commonly known as Saltychikha) (1730 – 1801) was a Russian serial killer and noble from Moscow who became notorious for torturing and killing over 100 of her serfs, mostly women and girls.

[–]capgras_delusion 6 points 4 years ago* 
Most, if not all of the stories are untrue or unfounded. I'll break it down in bullet points in reverse chronological order:

The most ridiculous claims (like people being skinned alive or merged with animals) were made up by certain ghost tour companies. You can hang out around the house, watch the tours go by, and hear a different version depending on the guide. It's fairly common knowledge that certain tour companies make shit up.

The only 'contemporary' account of the LaLauries was written by an abolitionist Brit, Harriet Martineau, who didn't show up in New Orleans until two years after the LaLauries disappeared. She was an obviously biased source in a time with lax journalistic standards. Besides that, fucking with tourists is a pastime in most cities (there's a reason why /r/neworleans has an Arby's logo and shoe in the header).

The abolitionist writer would naturally be looking for real or exaggerated horrors of slavery to bring back to England. LaLaurie was the perfect target: an established name, kind of a bitch, and out of the country. There's a reason the abolitionist writer didn't pick someone who was still living in the South: they would have fought back against what today would be called libel. Anyone who owned a significant number of slaves would also have money and influence.

The abolitionist writer claimed that LaLaurie used big spiked collars on her slaves. They were fucking nasty things intended to prevent slaves from running away. The real horror here is that those collars were entirely legal in Louisiana during LaLaurie's time. In fact, if you removed the collar against the owner's wishes, you'd face a fine of up to $1,000 (in early 1800s dollars) and up to six months in jail.

This is not to say that slavery wasn't bad; slavery is a horrific thing. This is just to say that LaLaurie's actions (giving spiked collars, chaining slaves in the kitchen) were standard for the time and place. That's what scares me.

A lot of this is from my own research combing through the first book about the LaLauries, looking through history books about slavery, and living in New Orleans. The evidence has all been out there, but I don't think anyone's put it all together in this way before.

tl;dr Leave LaLaurie alone

I think you're a tad bit off. I visited the house on a tour fairly recently, and it was said that her husband, a doctor, was the one who performed the experiments on the slaves in his attic. She did have a lot to do with torture as well though.

Psychology is the general study of human behavior and related sciences (psychoneurology, psychiatry). It's a more general term.

Psychiatry is specifically about using artificial chemicals to change brain chemistry, thereby changing behavior (i.e., psychoreactive drugs like Prozac).

I don't think psychiatry exclusively involves the using of using chemical compounds to treat illness.

[–]Wiki_FirstPara_bot 4 points 4 years ago 
First para from linked Wikipedia article Psychiatry:

Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the study and treatment of mental disorders. These mental disorders include various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities. The term was first coined by the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808, and literally means the 'medical treatment of the mind' (psych-: mind; from Ancient Greek psykhē: soul; -iatry: medical treatment; from Gk. iātrikos: medical, iāsthai: to heal). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a psychiatrist.

The Blackstone Chronicles is a serialized novel by American horror and suspense author John Saul. The series consists of six installments and takes place in a fictional New Hampshire town called Blackstone. The plot is that the old asylum is about to be demolished. In each chapter a different character receives a "gift" from an unknown source, and strange, terrible things begin to happen to the recipient (or those around them) shortly thereafter. The final novel reveals the connection between the various objects and the identity of the mysterious gift-giver.

Yeah, people think surgery is super advanced these days. It's not. It's still the same, messy thing that absolutely wrecks the body. Anything can go wrong. You know when you open up a computer and a wire isn't where the instruction manual said it would be? The human body can be like that, but even worse. And, instead of messing up something temporarily, cutting the wrong "wire" in the body can get bad fast. So no matter how "minor" the surgery, every time you go under the knife you are given a heads up that it could mean your death.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 2 points 4 years ago 
Well, computer do exactly what you tell them to, so it is kind of the same in the sense that it can go bad pretty quickly.

For example, when you tell a computer to copy a set of characters, like "hello" and you accidentally get the copy size off by one, so 4, you copy "hell" and corrupt the memory next to that with "o" which can be anything. It can be an instruction that jumps to the wrong memory and kills your CPU, it can be data that gets corrupted and something can get corrupted like your screen, etc.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]TehGinjaNinja 37 points 4 years ago 
The most important thing to remember about Loki is that he fits the archetype of a trickster god. This makes him a strategist and schemer who prefers to use misdirection to accomplish most of his goals.

Thor

At the start of the movie Thor is an arrogant, incompetent, impulsive prick. He is also set to take the throne of Asgard at a time the Frost giants are getting uppity; as proven by their willingness to launch an attempt to reclaim their most powerful weapon from the Asgardians.

Loki realizes that shit is about to go sideways, in a big way, as soon as Odin goes down for his nap. Loki needs to neutralize the threat his brother and the frost giants represent to Asgard. He manipulates the Frost Giants into infiltrating Asgard, thus reminding all Asgardians of the threat the FG represent. He then manipulates Thor into launching an ill-conceived reprisal against the FG, demonstrating that Thor is unfit to lead Asgard through the coming crisis. Odin responds by exiling Thor.

With Thor out of the way, Loki then convinces the FGs' leader to attempt to personally assassinate Odin. He "catches" the FGs in the act and kills their leader. With the assassination attempt as justification, he then launches an all out assault on the FGs using the Rainbow Bridge as a death ray.

If things had gone exactly as Loki planned Thor would simply have languished in exile, while the FGs got decimated as an example to any other potential trouble makers. The cosmos would have realized that you do not screw around while King Loki is on the throne, and peace would have reigned throughout the Nine Realms.

Unfortunately for everyone, the traitorous "Warriors Three", in direct violation of a royal edict, sneak down to Earth to convince Thor to return and usurp the Throne. At that point Thor and his friends have become a threat to cosmic security, and Loki has no choice but to unleash The Destroyer in an attempt to neutralize them. Tragically this has the unforeseeable side effect of Thor regaining his powers and returning to Asgard.

Thor, genius that he is, decides he has to save the FGs from his brother's 'evil schemes'. He accomplishes this by smashing his own people's strategic transportation infrastructure. In an act of truly God-Tier stupidity he spares the FGs the worst of the devastation Loki had planned for them, while simultaneously immobilizing Asgard's armies.

We later find out (in Thor 2) that a direct consequence of his actions is chaos throughout the nine realms which ultimately required an extensive military campaign to resolve. Thor is hailed as a hero for leading said campaign, despite the fact that he was a major cause of the problems. All of which would have been avoided if everyone had just done what Loki told them to do.

At the end of Thor, Loki slips away into the wider universe. Realizing that Asgard's armies are trapped in Asgard, he alone will be free to act to protect the interests of his adopted people. Pretty quickly he concludes that the Tesseract, a source of limitless energy which is capable of transporting armies across the cosmos, is not safe in the hands of humanity. We can't control it. We can't protect it. And we're using it to make weapons of mass destruction. However, returning the Tesseract to Odin would both keep it safe and restore mobility to Asgard's forces.

Cue The Avengers.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]TehGinjaNinja 30 points 4 years ago 
The Avengers

At the start of the Avengers our hero, Loki, is in a tough spot. He needs to get the Tesseract from Earth to Asgard, but he's got little to work with other than some magic and his own considerable wits. Unfortunately, Thanos, a well known cosmic ne're-do-well has learned of the Tesseract's location on Earth.

Loki decides to do what he does best, offer his the enemies of Asgard a deal, just so he can stab them in the back. He approaches Thanos and promises to get him the Tesseract in exchange for weapons, troops, and ownership of the Earth. This accomplishes two things, it provides Loki with the material resources he needs to take the Tesseract away from the ignorant humans who are fiddling with it, and it keeps Thanos from launching a more effective operation on his own.

Prior to contacting Thanos, Loki likely conducted a strategic assessment of Earth forces. It becomes clear through the events of the movie that he knew about all of shield's assets, he knew about the hulk, and he knew about Iron Man. It also becomes clear that he deliberately under-reports the strength of Earth's forces to Thanos, whose henchman even states, "The humans were not the weaklings we had been lead to believe."

As the movie unfolds, Loki deliberately baits all of the heroes into action. He kidnaps and brainwashes Hawkeye, ensuring both Hawkeye and Black widow will be personally invested in the final fight. He starts stomping around Europe and pontificating like a wanna-be dictator, which ensures Captain America will want a piece of the action ("The last time I saw a man standing above everyone else, we had a disagreement.").

He uses the scepter to trigger Banner's transforming into the Hulk. He sets up shop on top of Stark Tower. We know from Thor that he can hide from Baldur's magic omni-vision, but somehow Odin still learns what he's up to and sends Thor down to Earth to retrieve him.

Loki is a master manipulator; none of this is coincidence or accident. Despite having a history of stealthy actions and indirect scheming, he spends the whole movie putting on a show. Stark even calls him a "full-tilt diva" and refers to the final fight as "opening night". Loki does everything he can to bring the team together, short of shouting "Avengers Assemble"!

Finally, think about what Loki brings to the Battle of New York. The worm-hole he opens with the Tesseract is too small to function as anything other than a strategic bottle neck. At most, a couple of hundred Chitauri make it through, and those aren't very impressive.

I mean, come on, Hawkeye manages kill dozens with a freaking bow and arrows. Sure, he's a 'superhero', but his superpower is basically just being really good in combat. Think about it for a moment and you'll realize, Earth's conventional military forces would have made minced-meat out of the Chitauri as soon as they arrived on scene.

Worst case scenario (which almost happened), the Avengers fail and someone nukes NY. Even that would have sent a strong deterrent message, to anyone from another planet, thinking of conquering the Earth. Loki would have just dug the Tesseract out of the rubble, and used it to return to Asgard.

Then at the end, Loki is beaten and surrenders. This guy can turn invisible and create whole armies of illusory copies of himself. He could have snuck away if he wanted too. He doesn't, because for him it's "mission accomplished". He's going home with the Tesseract, and that's what he wanted from the start.

In the final analysis, the outcome of Loi's actions are dozens (maybe hundreds) dead in NY, and a crap load of property damage. However, Earth and Asgard are both safer than if Loki had done nothing. Again, that's not a coincidence or an accident.

And it's not just Earth and Asgard. Thanos is a genocidal maniac. There is no telling how much damage he could have done if he had gotten his hands on the Tesseract. Loki saved countless worlds, and did it while playing the villain. He did it, expecting no thanks or reward. He did it, just because it needed to be done. That's real heroism, and it's head and shoulders above Thor's accomplishments.

I think that's a far stretch. At the time, this was a new procedure, but it was thought highly promising. In a social time where there were far less options for those who were mentally handicapped, the thought that this new brain procedure could cure them is pretty tantalizing for a parent of a disabled child. We know now that lobotomy is not a viable option, but we didn't then. This Wikipedia article demonizes Kennedy Sr. quite a bit for this choice, but if a trained medical professional told me there was a procedure that would help my disabled child, I can't say that I wouldn't try it. The only reason we frown upon this now is because the outcome was poor; if it had been a success, we would consider Kennedy's choice a gutsy triumph.

I'm sure they slept perfectly fine. If the Dr. Freeman in the article is Dr. Walter Freeman, the man popularized the transorbital lobotomy as a cure for all manner of mental illness. This was before the era of reliable psychiatric drugs, when lobotomy was seen as practically a godsend for patients and caretakers alike. He saw no problem with using a lobotomy to calm a violent schizophrenic or to give relief to an anxiety-ridden housewife, or to make an unruly pre-teen boy fall in line. I've read a book about his life and another written by the recipient of his final lobotomy procedure. It was a fascinating and terrifying period of medical science.

I'd say being institutionalised, having no life, no family connections, then when you die not a single person in your family knows, attends your funeral. You have an impairment and live out your days with no quality of life at all, it strikes me as grossly sad, at least the Kennedy's had their kid in their family.

this is probably the most fucked up thing I've read in a while on Reddit. at 23 how/why did she consent to that, if she did at all? and she was awake. and because it's the Kennedy family it just got swept under the rug. holy shit - this makes Shutter Island look like a Disney movie.

Consent? What kind of consent would a mentally handicapped girl be able to give?

Rosemary Kennedy's behavior prior to the lobotomy is well documented as being pretty fucking terrible for the time. Like "crashing a dinner party to masturbate frantically in front of the Kennedy's guests" kind of terrible.

What was done to her was horrible, but in no way was Rosemary a coherent adult. As she aged she regressed to, for lack of a better phrase pre-coffee, "full retard", and lobotomy was the answer to this in the early 20th century.

"[her father] thought her sexuality was too intense and untempered by the moral strictures to which the other daughters had adhered."

True, but as he doesn't seem to have come down as hard on his other kids there might be something to her behavior.

There are other sources for her behavioral problems, and they probably weren't really bad enough to warrant a lobotomy.

I accept that her dad was probably an asshole, but that doesn't mean she wasn't mentally ill.

She was kept in a facility in Rural WI, not far from where I went to college. One of my brothers ended up working there for a bit, but I think it was in the convalescent home, and not in Kennedy's "private" facility

It was a really crazy place, out in the middle of nowhere. I think it used to be a boarding school for troubled kids.

[–]Homerpaintbucket 1 point 4 years ago 
Honestly you can't judge the Kennedy's on this. This was just what doctors recommended you do to developmentally disabled kids with behavior problems at this time. It does seem fucked up, and frankly it is, but you have to realize we did not have the kinds of psychological tools to deal with these types of behaviors at that time. This was decades before Skinner and token economies. This was a time when Freud's ideas were still given consideration.

On a side note, this incident directly led to the founding of the Special Olympics, which is frankly an awesome organization. I work with developmentally disabled people and you can't imagine the sense of pride some of my clients get from competing in the Special Olympics. They freaking beam with pride. I had one guy who wore his medals into work for like 2 months straight. He came in every day Michael Phelpsed out like a boss. The guy is awesome on so many levels.

In 1941, when Kennedy was 23, doctors told her Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. that a new neurosurgical procedure, a lobotomy, would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts. He decided that his daughter should have the lobotomy performed, but did not inform his wife Rose until after the procedure was completed.

One of the doctors who performed this procedure on Ms. Kennedy, Dr. Walter Freeman, went on to perform transorbital lobotomies on 2,500 patients in 23 states.

In 1952 he performed 228 transorbital lobotomies in a two-week period in my home state of West Virginia. Perhaps the most sinister part of this act, besides it simply happening, is that it was for a state-sponsored lobotomy project.

I don't know if "enjoyed" is the right word here.

"Meiwes amputated Brandes' penis and the two men attempted to eat the penis together before Brandes was killed. Brandes had insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work and ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes' penis. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw, but could not because it was too tough and, as he put it, "chewy". Meiwes then fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic; he then fried it with some of Brandes' fat but by then it was too burned to be consumed. He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog." - From Wikipedia.

Maybe they "attempted to enjoy" it, but it sounds like poor preparation ruined the meal.

Probably, but we don't speak anymore, we both went after the same girl and he kept going after her after she was dating me. He was born in Germany and had friends who worked IT for the police, and they had hard-copies.

[–]GroundhogExpert 1 point 4 years ago 
There were hours, we skipped around a bit, not very well lit and INCREDIBLY eerie. Knowing what ultimately has to happen might amplify that. This was years ago, and the largest impression on me was watching this guy who was alive and talking getting slowly less life-like from being inebriated and losing blood, some grunting through pain and then when he's finally killed in the tub. After that, his body is treated like a slab of meat. Miewes was disgustingly proud of everything he was doing.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Orwells 1 point 4 years ago 
Can you remember if they had any long conversations together? if so what were they about? Did you see the butchering and eating?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]GroundhogExpert 4 points 4 years ago 
There was definite talking, but the quality wasn't very good, and I don't remember paying attention to anything in specific. I ended up paying attention more to the fact that he was otherwise lively, didn't seem depressed, which made his desire to die seem more like a mental disease and Miewes was more like a predator taking advantage of a sick person.

We watched a little bit after Brandes died, not much though. At a certain point, it's just egregious. Too much to watch for no point. And Miewes appeared very happy with himself, which made it way more uncomfortable to sit through. It's not like he was sick and couldn't control himself. Brandes was distinctly not in control and needed coaxing. Miewes was just so smug.

Ok so you know this just happened AGAIN here in Germany:

[–]ucbiker 2 points 4 years ago 
The guy he ate was actually the second guy who responded to the ad. IIRC, another guy had answered the ad chickened out, so him and Armin Meiwes ended up ordering a pizza, getting some beers, and watching TV.

[–]Jigsus 1 point 4 years ago 
good call

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Drew-Pickles 2 points 4 years ago 
The worst thing about the story is that Meiwes genuinely seemed like a nice guy. One guy who he invited over, who had every intention of being eaten, backed out when it came down to it. And so what did Meiwes do? Did he go into a frenzy and kill him anyway? No. He invited him to the cinema. And they had a good time.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]pn42 2 points 4 years ago* 
also, Bloodbath's Eaten is about this. (very good Death metal song)

(also, the man was titled " Der Kannibale von Rothenburg", Armin Meiwes iirc, Rothenburg being the city where appearently he btuchered his lover.

it was huge when it happnend on the media. the guy itself does not really seem that abnormal/insane in person.

I have a somewhat similar view. It involved consent by both parties, but the act of cannibalism in general is illegal, so that explains the jail time.

Under what circumstances does it become legal? As in, if I were in a shipwreck and ate some guy, and told my story to the press, would I get in trouble or would it be fine because it was in a reasonable situation of survival? How close to that line can someone skate?

Wolf of Wall Street was amazing, and the script for Devil in the White City is solid, they just need to attach the right filmmaker a renew Leo's interest in actually making the movie. It's been gestating for a long time, which often means it's never actually going to happen. A period piece with a serial killer as it's main character isn't an easy sell with out Leo (or someone of his ilk) attached to star.

I didn't love Wolf of Wall St., but you can't deny Leo and Jonah Hill were both excellent in that movie. It's what made the 3 hours tolerable. although it become more of a black comedy in the second half...you really sensed that in the qualude Lemon 714 scene.

btw, I've actually had some of those genuine Lemon 714s. got them teh same way actually. a college buddy showed up with a bottle of them (this was in the early 90s). however, i'm sorry to report that the effect was the opposite. they got weaker over time. i also once found a bunch of old morphine and dilaudids. the dilaudids (liquid and pills) had grown super weak but the morphine was still really good.

it's nto really a murder mystery. it's pretty clear from the get-go that he's murdering people. but the book flip-flops between the Holmes story and the story of the 1893 World Fair in Chitown (where i live).

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

Ah I see. I just saw murder on the cover and assumed mystery. Is it a biography, or more of a pseudo biography?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Spiritually_Obese 1 point 4 years ago 
sorry for the delay, my laptop died and I just go a new one. I wouldn't call it a biography. It's more of a true story about how this guy lived and committed so many murders. And he happened to do this in Chicago against the backdrop of the 1893 World Fair. So half the book is dedicated to how the city planned and pulled that off, which actually ends up being even more interesting than the murder/crime part of the book.

It is def Larson's best work and I've read several of his books.

My pessimistic guess is that a film would focus mainly, if not wholly, on the Holmes murders.

Part of what was so wonderful about that book was the contrast between the the thread about Holmes, and the thread about the World's Fair. They contrasted wonderfully without jarring, but I don't see how they could fit both into a film.

YES! Finally! A movie is being made from a book that I read before hearing about the movie! So this is what it feels like to be a movie/book hipster? I'm usually behind the curve on these things.

Hunger Games? Movie had already been announced.

The Hunt for Red October? I was YEARS behind on that one.

Patriot Games? Same story.

The Sum of All Fears? I started reading when I heard about the movie, only got about halfway, watched the movie, then abandoned it. Both were meh.

DaVinci Code? Movie was weeks from opening, but I still finished it before watching. Book was WAY better, btw.

October Sky? Read the book in school, but the movie had already been out for a while.

The Phantom Menace? Obviously the book was written after the movies were announced. Not sure which was better. Probably the movie because you don't have to spend weeks on it.

Eragon. I enjoyed the first book, despite it obviously being written by a teenager (which I started reading when I heard about the movie being made), but when I heard the reviews of the movie I lost interest in both. Never saw it, didn't continue the series.

Before anyone asks I've never read any of LotR or Potter, and don't have much interest. Hopefully one day they'll make a movie out of Without Remorse or Red Storm Rising. I guess there's hope if Shadow Recruit does well.

Oh man, this is a terrible idea, there is WAY too much going on in that book to be squeezed into a 2-3 hour movie.

Not precisely. Serial killers leave considerable gaps between killings. The first recorded serial killer was a Roman woman named Locusta of Gaul.

Just to play devils advocate here... I could be wrong feel free to correct me. But regardless of profit or social gain if you are consistently killing people are you not a serial killer? I mean it's hard to say she didn't get visceral pleasure or psychological urges to do this, it obviously happened more then once. Or does that make you not a serial killer but something else if you do it for profit? What about if you employ an army to do it, or a bomb, would politicians that give orders to kill be considered serial killers if it happens over a period of time with gaps in between?.....

This is correct. While she did allegedly kill one person after another, in a series of murders, she does not fit with the standard connotations of a serial killer. An executioner, for example, kills a series of people, but is not generally recognized to be a serial killer. Here is a good rule of thumb; if someone is paying you to do it, congratulations you are the Zodiac.

I can recall plenty of land wars in Asia that went the way of the aggressor. Even if we exclude Asian based aggressors there will be plenty of people who have successfully concluded wars in Asia.

Alexander the Great - Conquered the Persian empire as well as quite a few other territories in Asia.

Ptolomy/Antigonus - Won several battles/wars during the successor wars.

Philip V of Macedonia - Took possession of parts of one of Ptolomies descendants during the second Macedonian war, tough he ultimately lost against Rome.

Roman Generals with success in Asia.

Scipio Africanus - Syrian War

Sulla - Mithradic war

Pompey Magnus - Mithradic war (again), as well as a shitload of other wars

Ceasar - Civil War

Augustus - Civil War 2, Wars against the Parthians

And several more including the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) who had about 1000 years of wars against Asian powers, and quite often came out on top.

Gonna skip to more modern times now.

Muscovite/Russian conquest of a shitload of land.

British Conquest of India.

Dutch colonisation/conquest of Java and other territories.

Spanish yada yada of Philippines.

The Opium war against China.

American subjugation of the Philippines.

World War 2 Pacific Theater including the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

The colosseum was in use from roughly 80 AD until the early medieval period for entertainment purposes, including gladiatorial combat as well as simulated sea battles. Within a single 123 day span, in 107 AD, 11,000 animals and 10,000 humans were involved in events.

Yes, but the 10.000 humans were not all killed during the events. Gladiators were trained professionists/slaves with a high cost of training. Kill them in a shot was not a good idea.

The idea of actual death in arenas is similar to believe to John Cena injured arms.

It's common knowledge.

If you need some other sources you can search on the WP page.

As the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, matches sine missione were officially banned, a pragmatic Augustan decision that also happened to reflect popular demands for "natural justice". Refusals by Caligula and Claudius to spare popular but defeated fighters did nothing to boost their own popularity. In most circumstances, a gladiator who fought well was likely to be spared.[106]

Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional munus by Nero, in which no-one was killed, "not even noxii (enemies of the state)."[107]

Moreover, isn't your hoax sense tickling when you heard about a fight to death for impress urbanized people?

I'm on my work computer and currently filling up any logs they have of me with terrible search history inquiries BUT I learned on this fine site in a TIL a while back that there was a Roman who trained animals to rape people. And it wasn't just giraffes either.

IIRC, he would start the animals young at it and use either a scent put on the victim to get the animal going and when his career was done- instead of giving away all his secrets, he said it had to do with a special necklace or something that he had and I think he sold it- further fooling those who wanted to copy him.

I don't remember the story and after a few unsuccessful Google searches about "roman animals taught to rape"- I realize this is not what I want to come up in my search history or anywhere else for that matter on my work computer.

If you don't find anything yourself today- I'll try to search it out tonight.

it's not - this was actually a fairly common practice in rome with all animals, not just giraffes.

animals' sexuality function by way of olfactory (smelling) pheromones and the romans knew this (they were pretty smart, those romans). as such, they would take a female animal (in this instance, a giraffe) who was ripe for mating, and they would collect that animal's urine.

then, they'd take this pheromone sexpanther piss-perfume, and douse the human who was ripe for the raping in it before marching him/her out into the coliseum (or any amphitheater gladiator games took place at) naked, bent over in doggy style position, and inhibit that person from moving.

finally, they would take sexually depraved male animal of the same genus, march that bad boy into the middle of the arena, and upon smelling the pheromones, it would charge into center stage and ram it's 3 foot long dong into whatever poor individual was drenched in said sexpanther.

the resulting sex would cause so much internal damage that the victim would almost die - usually from internal bleeding. eventually, the male animals did this so much it just became a matter of conditioning.

hormones are a hell of a drug.

TL;DR - Romans were as fucked up as they were intelligent and this is a historical fact: animals were indeed trained to rape humans.

No, serial killers commit murders in series, as opposed to en masse, or amidst a spree. There are a number of strikingly prolific serial killers with only days or weeks between killings because their circumstances and chosen victims combine to form a wealth of opportunity and dearth of suspicion. There is overlap between the names we assign to various types of murderers, but the time separation need not be considerable, as the time gaps are a function of the environment, not the killer.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]ChainerSummons 1 point 4 years ago 
Serial killers, by necessity, need what is called a 'cooling off period.' In Locusta's case, repeating the same method of murder as well as murdering more than the minimum of three individuals with cooling off periods inbetween settles her nicely into the 'Serial killer' category. She does not fit 'Mass murderer' as she did not kill a large amount of people in one sitting, nor does she fit 'Spree killer' as she did not kill regularly.

[–]respectthegoat 1 point 4 years ago* 
Ok lets just look at the facts shall we Holmes was born in 1861 he is thought to have started killing in 1888 but he might have started a year or two earlier who knows

Micajah "Big" Harpe was born around 1768 his brother Wiley "Little" Harpe was born around 1770 that would so they are older then Holmes by about 90 years. in 1797 they go around raping and killing with a group of Cherokee Indians. they then spend the rest of there lives killing people and running farther west it is thought that they may have killed 40+ people between them. but some parts of there story are unreliable but they are thought to be America's first serial killers.

Delphine LaLaurie was born in 1775 in 1834 her house was burned and it was reviled that she had several slaves chained up and that they had been tortured over a long period of time.

The Bloody Benders were a family that owned a small inn. in 1873 11 bodies were found on there property with there skulls bashed in although there could have been more. They were without a doubt serial killers.

The Servant Girl Annihilator was an unknown serial killer that killed 16 girls in Austin Texas in 1884, 4 years before Holmes started.

And Finally Joseph Briggen started feeding his farmhands to his pigs in 1880, 8 years before Holmes but he was not found out until 1902 he killed 12+ people.

so in short your documentaries either got the facts wrong or lied to spice up the story.

From Wikipedia:

"The ground floor of the Castle contained Holmes's own relocated drugstore and various shops, while the upper two floors contained his personal office and a maze of over 100 windowless rooms with doorways opening to brick walls, oddly-angled hallways, stairways to nowhere, doors openable only from the outside, and a host of other strange and labyrinthine constructions. Holmes repeatedly changed builders during the construction of the Castle, so only he fully understood the design of the house."

There is also a theory by a contemporary distant relative that he was Jack the Ripper too, having supposedly been in England during the time of the murders. How much of this is true I don't know. This guy wrote a book, Bloodstains, about all these horrific journals from Holmes. He will not state whether or not the journals are real (supposedly because them the government would be after them), yet he has worked with handwriting experts to compare them and the famous note from Jack the Ripper. It's all a bit odd, because he certainly acts like they are real, but when questioned point blank he won't say.

Have there been multiple people to have done this? I was in a home in Scotland that was set up exactly as his "murder castle" was described. The slanted hallways, stairs to nowhere, a door that was on a very high floor that led to nothing - you fall out of the building and die. I think it was the home of a woman obsessed with daisies.

All the sink drains were 13 petal daisies.

To google! (I may be meshing two different places together.)

Edit: Nevermind. Found it. Winchester Mystery House. A woman built a house just like a death maze that only she knew the layout of, but instead of killing people, she used it to keep "evil spirits" from finding her.

Unit 731. Heard of Josef Mengele? These guys were doing similar fucked up experimentation in Asia, including germ warfare and this:

Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia.[15] Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Scientists performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results.[16] The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.[17]

The most fucked up thing about this is that most of them were granted immunity in exchange for their experiment data, concerning germ warfare and some other things.

In 2007, the Japanese army surgeon Ken Yuasa testified to the Japan Times that, "I was afraid during my first vivisection, but the second time around, it was much easier.

What country are you from? When your country has been invaded and subjected to atrocities, you will hear about it no matter what.

Yeah, exactly. But OP mentionned that he's Chinese though, so I guess (at least I hope?) that he was taught more about Unit 731 than about Auschwitz. The debate was about whether or not such shocking images should be shown to early teens. I answered about my own experience.

I'm not sure about what you meant in your comment, but if your goal was to say "that's a shame education is not more global" then I agree. I'd have liked to learn about Unit 731 and Shiro Ishii before I discovered Reddit and TIL. Hell, there are a hundred facts I learnt about my country that are less historically important than the Nankin Massacre, and still during the many lessons that I took on WWII, never once was it mentionned.

Not sure about where you are from, but I know as a result of the Japanese being with the AXIS, in Canada, we put many people of Japanese origin into camps in BC. I suspect part of the fear would be people taking it in a way that wasn't appropriate. I knew one friend who found out about Nankin who was of HK origin, and said, that's why I can't be friends with you anymore to a Japanese origin Canadian. (she was something like 4th or 5th generation Canadian to boot...)

That said, it might not have been just the child's inability to understand, as this girl mentioned to me that she hated that many parents of friends held that over her, and made her feel like she should feel ashamed for it, when her family was locked away in a camp in BC, Canada...

I can't speak to how history is taught today, but when I was in high school in the late 80s, we learned fuck all about the atrocities of war and the things that out own country did to it's citizens. When My dad told me about the internment camps here in the US, I couldn't believe we weren't taught about those, so that was what I wrote my history paper about. Not a popular decision, but I was angry that it had been purposely omitted from pretty much everything in school. The number of other students who thought I'd just made it up was surprising.

I think it's ridiculous to shield children from these horror stories. The world is full of terror and beauty, man-made and natural. Kids are more than capable of processing disturbing information.

Human advancement away from the need to be so close and personal to many tasks has caused a shelter effect for many. This is especially true for western countries. Being so removed causes an inability to handle gruesome facts, which in turn causes them to feel someone younger cannot handle it since them, as an adult, cannot handle it.

I too believe we should not shield children from the truth or the world. Better to know what exists of is possible than to not and pay for it later. It makes us more understanding as people besides.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

To be fair a lot of eastern countries don't have a problem with shielding children, as they just keep the entire populace in the dark. That said, I don't think western countries shield so much, as there are certain things that are stressed in education. I mean it might not make sense to teach calculus at too young an age, as there may not be the requisite understanding by most of the students. Are there young people who learn it? Yes. And I think those able to handle it will step forward somehow. I remember when I first heard about Pythagoras (the right angle rule), and mentioned to my teacher that I thought there must be some relationship for other angles, but that through a lot of testing I wasn't able to get it exactly...

In any case the fact that some middle school child was in fact able to find the material, and was more advanced, as evidenced by whatever this "TAG" program is. Just my 2 cents.

You're 14. It's very likely that you have never experienced true pain or death. You don't know what it's like to have someone ripped from you. You've never seen true cruelty or horror, more importantly you don't even have tools to process it. You aren't phased because what you are reading seems like some sort of Horror movie or TV show. This happened to real people. Real screams, real cuts, real blood, real disease. You aren't phased because you're either ignorant or have no empathy. I hope it's the first one.

No, where I am from (near Chicago) it goes: Pre-school: 3, 4, and 5 years olds (few 3 year olds though, some parents choose two years of preschool and some do one) Kindergarten: 5-6 year olds (one year of kindergarten) Primary school: 1st-3rd grade Middle school: 4th-5th (some schools also include 6th grade here) Junior high: 6th-8th (a very few schools do 7th-9th) High school: 9th grade you are a freshmen, 10th your are a sophomore (translate to 'wise fool', they're so fucking cocky), 11th grade is Junior, 12th is senior, if you are held back for a 5th year the joke is that you are a super-senior)

I did a research paper on Mengele in high school. What scared me the most wasn't his inhumanity, but his humanity. One of the Sonderkommando with a medical background worked with Mengele doing autopsies. He spoke with Mengele about wanting to know if his wife and child were still alive. Mengele expressed regret in knowing that his colleague's family was in the camps, and gave him permission to look for them. The sonderkommando found his wife and child alive, and told Mengele. Mengele told the man that a train was coming for a camp that treated its prisoners well, as they were required for important factory work, and to tell the family to volunteer to go there. Mengele did, his family obeyed, and if I remember correctly, they all lived through the war. The fact that Mengele can mercilessly murder so many people but have compassion for this single Jewish family is honestly horrifying. Even the worst of the Nazis were human beings that felt compassion, and despite their compassion, still committed these atrocities.

This is the book I read it in, I'm not sure if the doctor was a Sonderkommando or not, but he certainly feared for his life throughout the whole ordeal. An excellent read for anyone interested in this sort of thing.

Carlo Mattogno ( Orvieto , 1951 ) is an essayist, Italian, considered the leading exponent of Holocaust denial in Italy.

Like /u/Ipooda, I don't often make bibliographic notes about everything I read for use in future reddit conversations. Maybe if it touched a chord in you, you could do some research on your own and share it with the class.

I get asking for sources, but I feel like comments like these can actually be incredibly low value for conversations, especially in threads like these that are just going to be full of anecdotes someone read once. I mean, the top post is some bullshit story about George H.W. Bush and cannibals.

I can't find anything to corroborate the allegation that it is "totally sexed up". If anything, after having read a few pages on and collections of reviews of it, I'm more inclined to read it, as historiographic criticisms are few. The only people I've been able to find railing against it in a general way are Stormfront types (for obvious reasons).

It's possible this is a broadly inaccurate text and its inaccuracy has simply gone under the radar and fooled most contemporary readers in the process. But it would seem surprising.

That having said, anything you can point to to that effect would certainly be of interest.

First para from linked Wikipedia article Dunbar's number:

Dunbar's number is suggested to be a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. No precise value has been proposed for Dunbar's number. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 230, with a commonly used value of 150. Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on long-term memory size.

This idea is greatly portrayed in one of the Dr. Who episodes when David Tennant Christopher Eccleston was still the doctor (as billie piper the companion, so somewhere around season 1 or 2ish). In this episode, an green alien (called Raxacoricofallapatorians) asks the doctor to spare her because she spared a human earlier that week when she would've usually killed her. Eccleston retorts by saying that "compassion towards one individual does not satisfy the millions [you've] killed". Yes of course their act of compassion is unexpected. However, they've still committed horrible acts of murder and are/have expected to cleanse their guilt through showing compassion to one individual. Other great examples would be Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld in the pianist where he saves Władysław Szpilman (the main character and pianist) during the holocaust by providing him warmth and food. Hitler could've also showed signs of compassion towards some people; however, his crimes far outweigh any sort of benign acts he performed.

All in all, it's not surprising that humans show unexpected signs of compassion; those that do while having committed horrible deeds are more so exercising their power by showing compassion (as Schindler in Schindler's list pointed out to Amon Goeth). Others try to cure their guilt by doing good which obviously is futile.

[–]Naterdam 3 points 4 years ago 
I'd say that the level of humanity is both scary and not scary. Scary in that it wasn't just pure craziness going on, less scary since that means people like Mengele really lived for the science. You have to realize that the doctors often did not think of these people as people. The propaganda called the Jews rats: if you was a doctor you would likely have no problem cutting up rats. Thus, if you were a doctor and essentially believed in such propaganda, cutting up people would not be much different. In their mind, they weren't evil: they did the right thing. It's like when you're eating meat for example, you don't consider yourself evil for that.

I never really saw Josef Mengele as a Nazi. I saw him more as a doctor who worked for the Nazis because they both had a common goal: research. Yes, he did some fucked up stuff that nobody could ever be okay with (I hope), but he didn't do it because he hated Jews, he did it for science. I don't know if that makes him better or worse, but, somehow it matters to me.

Also because a lot of people confuse "Mendel" and "Mengele" and I was called a Nazi in high school when learning about him.

Eh, he was worse than most Nazis. The experiments he did on Jews, twins, and Gypsies were torture. He might have helped one family (maybe) but he was a sadistic monster. You can cloak it under the guise of "science" but it was nothing more than subjecting people to ridiculous torture because he could. And that Nazi managed to evade capture and trial for his many crimes.

Like I said, I don't know if it's better or worse. Is torturing someone out of racism better than torturing someone out of sadism? Are you a better kind of monster because your morals are less discriminatory? There is no lesser of the two evils, but there's certainly a greater among them. I don't know, but it makes me feel like we haven't seen the last of those types of experiments.

I guess I just don't see anything noble about his experiments or his motives. What difference does it make if he was a racist and/or a sadist? I was mostly referring to your considering him "not really a Nazi" because he did medical experiments instead of just gassing them. If you read about his time at Auschwitz, he's one of the worst, most cruel Nazis (and that says a lot). He has more actual blood on his hands than any of the higher echelon and he knew every one of his subjects personally. And honestly, a lot of his experiments were just stupid, especially the twin stuff.

Wikipedia:

Sonderkommandos were work units of Nazi death camp prisoners, composed almost entirely of Jews, who were forced, on threat of their own deaths, to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims during The Holocaust. The death-camp Sonderkommando, who were always inmates, should not be confused with the SS-Sonderkommandos which were ad hoc units formed from various SS officers between 1938 through 1945.

The term itself in German means "special unit", and was part of the vague and euphemistic language which the Nazis used to refer to aspects of the Final Solution (cf. Einsatzgruppen).

[–]gamegeek1995 1 point 4 years ago 
/u/kgram's response is spot on, but I want to add to it that Sonderkommando were picked from the trains while still healthy, always the strongest of the men. Every three months or so, the unit was murdered and new Sonderkommando were picked. Some of them actually rebelled, in the book they have a little firefight with the Nazi guards and manage to blow up a few of the furnaces before being gunned down.

Just as Adolf Hitler allowed for many immunities and even attempted to have his homosexual mentor (from the Nazi Party) sentenced to a jail term instead of death. The doctor that cared for his mother, a jewish man, was granted immunity to the country of his choosing and was given pass after he had failed to evacuate Germany prior. If you read many of the bios on high profile nazi members you'll be shocked as to what they might have been like as human beings apart from their nazi-esque images. Hitler for example, looked like a hard working young man that sacrificed so much of his life to care for his sick and widowed mother, raise his orphaned siblings or, at minimum, support them...and then he traveled throughout the new German state and the surrounding territories, looking for work and experience, even living amongst the Jewish community in Vienna - growing to appreciate them and their efforts to support their community and rise out of the poverty that many in the city had succumbed to. He began to become passionate about politics and what life ought to be like in order to help the working peoples of nations....soon after he began to grow as a human being WW1 rolls around and he jumps into a Bavarian unit and spends some miserable time in the trenches of Western Europe. He gets back to Germany, a shaken but unchanged man, and is then recruited by a government agency to audit new political parties and groups that are gaining momentum in Germany. One such group he was auditing was spewing so much rhetoric and disgusting philosophy around that he began to rush out of the room angrily, and when stopped and chastised by an official of the group for looking so bitter, he passionately tore into him. Later, the head officials of this group began to contact him and actively pursue such a charismatic and passionate man for the face of the movement...they found him, and worked with him, slowly undermining all of the personal and progressive gains that he had made as a person through out his experiences in life. He did a complete 180 on his philosophies on Nationalism, what he once thought to be a poison, on religion, what he once thought to be the worst weapon the leaders of society could use to undermine the working class [when institutionalized], and began to absolutely abhor the community that had accepted him and helped him through his struggles when he was starving in Vienna...he saw them as a poison that was undermining true Germanic peoples...not as an example that they should follow...but a faction that was only organized and so well put together because they did not truly belong to Germany and thus did not endure her pains. The story is quite sad really, as the rest is history...

But sometimes, if you look at some of his actions throughout his campaign, beneath his terrible actions, you will see glimmers of the young man that once appeared to be the face of a new, great, progressive Germany...the embodiment of something great to come. Sadly, power corrupts even the greatest of character at times, and desperate men, that once stood naked before the world battling all she threw at them, turn their faces to integrity and loyalty for a new destiny. He absolutely sold his soul and surrendered his individuality because he was sick and tired and saw a way out of his struggle for his friends and family...an easy way. But again, it's just terrifying and depressing to see what he might have tried to do under the radar of his regime...that that young man, that brilliant child, and passionate warrior for a greater humanity was still fighting to gain a foothold on the demon that consumed his mind and body.

None of this condones what Hitler did...from attempting to destroy an entire people to plunging a world entire war and seeing father's grieve the deaths of their sons, when he was once convinced that the case should always be opposite. It does not mean that he needs the respect of people for who he had been, prior to who he became...in fact the opposite must be true as she showed himself to have no integrity when a decision over his soul came down to a choice at the margin. The case is simply a tragedy, and a reminder to all people, now and again, that we must reign true to our convictions no matter what, as wavering on them, and acting blindly in one direction or the other, might result in catastrophe...that forgoing the rights of other human beings and training yourself to hate their very nature might only lead to bloodlust. If you give into power entirely, whether it be politics, religion, money, or other status...you have become a fool...you can no longer change the world...or at least not for the better.

It sucks, but it is a great reminder, and a sad and horrible tale that is quite true and horrific.

The first shot was fired by Sergeant. His target was a mere (small) boy, who was coming down the mountain path.

The shooting attracted the villagers, who came out of their homes in alarm. They did not display a weapon, made no hostile movement whatsoever, but they were still ruthlessly (cruelly) shot down in cold blood, men, women and children. The poor natives huddled together or fled in terror. Many were pursued and killed on the spot. Two old men, bearing a white flag and clasping hands like two brothers, approached the lines. Their hair was white. They were literally stumbling; they were so feeble under the weight of years (they were so old). To my horror and that of the other men, the order was given to fire and the two old men were shot down in their tracks.”

Either because he did not do any experiments or because they did not survive the war.

Japanese war criminals were however prosecuted in the International Tribunal for the Far East.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]deLamartine 10 points 4 years ago* 
There is a general misconception on the purpose of punishment (especially on reddit). Theory of criminal justice recognizes four purposes of punishment:

Deterrent theory: prevention of other crimes being committed (because of the general fear of punishment).
Retributive theory: the goal is to try to rebalance any unjust advantage gained by ensuring that the offender also suffers a loss. -> what you may call vengeance or lex talionis.
Preventive theory: which is the protection of others from the offender.
Reformative theory: the goal is to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct (correction of the penalised).
Punishment encompasses those four purposes all together. Every State choses to what extent they want to valorise each of them, but it is important to acknowledge that punishment includes all of them!

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]FredFnord 0 points 4 years ago 
Pfah. You and your theories and you hypo-theeses. We know what punishment is for in the US, and it's 90% 'revenge' and 10% 'keep the scary brown people away from me daddy!'

And we hope maybe the revenge might prove a deterrent, but we don't really care about that at all (or we would actually use our knowledge of what makes an effective deterrent.) And we can no longer even pretend to care about rehabilitation: in any jurisdiction where the public has the slightest bit of say in crime and punishment, when given a choice between two alternatives, they invariably demand the one that will make rehabilitation more difficult, even in the few cases where the options are clearly explained and the issue is not demagogued by some right-wing asshole.

As someone who is working on his PhD in science, from what I can tell, a large amount of the shit that was passed off as "science" in those camps wasn't up to par when it came to experimental design. Because of its poor design its utility is limited at best.

Retrospectively, given that anti-intellectuals love to tie any science done today back to the holocaust or similar death camps run by the Japanese because there was "science" done there too, it would have been better if we hanged all the fuckers instead and used the data as public evidence as to why we hanged the evil SOBs.

A great deal of what we know about hypothermia is from the experiments done by Nazis. They were motivated by a desire to find out how to save their soldiers etc, and they were prepared to kill people they saw as lesser to gather that data. While those experiments should never have been done, obviously, if there can be some good salvaged out of that unspeakable evil then surely that is better than just throwing the research away because of how it was obtained. Knowing about hypothermia, for example, could have saved many lives.

I totally understand where you are coming from, though. It is a thorny issue and using the data seems almost to endorse the research, as long as we can hang the person who did it to absolve our species of the guilt afterwards.

We can never, ever repeat anything that has been done in this place so this information could potentially be lost forever if we don't take it.

Unlike the Nazi experimentation, the Japanese actually kept extensive records of their experiments. There's no reason not to use this information and this people once the act was committed.

I had to do a research essay on this as a freshmen in college. Depressed and disgusted the hell outta me, and it certainly requires awareness. Not many people are aware of the horrors that happened at unit 731

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 19 points 4 years ago* 
Japan employed Unit 731 to develop powerful biological weapons, experimenting on prisoners. And they managed to do so by breeding rats infested with plague-infected fleas.

Unit 731 also developed an innovative method to deliver small payloads to America, Fire Balloons, relying on the Jet Stream to fly across the ocean from Japan straight to America. They tested it and it worked, it resulted in a couple of deaths (some family at a picnic), and was the only direct foreign attack on America in US history history (up until 9/11). (Edit: Seems the war of 1812 disproved this)

Combine these two facts. The Japanese had almost perfected the ability to launch biological weapons on the United States, and would have done so if they weren't forced into surrender. If the US had delayed any longer, they could have suffered catastrophic causalities on their own home soil. This fact blows my mind.

This contributed in part to the continued hostility between Asian nations and Japan.

In the west, the Nazis got their day in court. Those who could escape would die either from vigilante actions or alone and exiled forever.

But in the Eastern theater, show trials and exonerations and and politically motivated pardons were de riguere. And the longer we let this sit, the more evidence we'll lose to time and mortality, and the more obfuscation there will be - whether from Japanese apologists and war crime deniers, or from cynical autocratic dictatorships inflating past injustices to provide a convenient scapegoat.

In many ways, the Allies sowed the seeds of this continuing resentment by failing to administer justice for all. In the end, it was justice for Europe, makeshift middle-through for Asia. And this resentment will continue as long as politicians on both sides find it easier to point fingers and demonize, than to actually engage and compromise.

Thing that really gets me about Unit 731 is the fact America pardoned the culprits in order to obtain the data for personal use.

I mean, you're also leaving out the fact that the Japanese had recorded instances of cannibalizing prisoners (Flyboys, read it) and also using prisoners as live bayonetting practice (Hidden Horrors, another great read) as well as raping women, and when there weren't enough holes, guess what!! Those rascally Japanese made sure to create some extra room to accommodate everyone! (anything ever written on the Rape of Nanking)

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]BlackCaaaaat 1 point 4 years ago 
In a nutshell, what is the difference?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Verlux 2 points 4 years ago 
Pacific theatre: Japanese treated prisoners as slave labor, wholesale slaughtered them near the end of the war with nary a thought, even from the beginning viewed (specifically white prisoners) as non-human enemies, inherently xenophobic racial bias strongly evident

Eastern Front: the most POWs of any war died on this front (statistically, more than every POW death in all other wars combined [technicalities could be raised to argue this down, but it's essentially true]), well over 1 million Slavs and Russians were frozen/starved/shot/tortured/beaten to death intentionally, on orders from Hitler; even before the order from Hitler, Slavs and Communists were still killed in high numbers; blatant political reasoning, inherent racial bias can be argued based off Mein Kampf readings

Western Front: less than 5% of all POWs on this front ended up dead; few, if any, of this % are believed to be as a result of mistreatment. Geneva Convention upheld to the fullest extent possible in almost all recorded scenarios, leading to the conclusion that white on white captivity (using white loosely, as is colloquially used in the 21st century) was the only captivity in which prisoners were treated well. Incidentally, this is also a "control group" of sorts, since it's the only theatre of war where Geneva Convention guidelines were completely upheld.

The plan was for him to appear as the victim. He thought the police would let him get the money to the others, who would escape, after which he would get the bomb removed. He didn't know that the other two wanted him dead and had shortened the timer on the bomb. They were hoping for a two-fer.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]dr_guitar 4 points 4 years ago 
Right but I was thinking since the bomb detonated 30 minutes after the 911 call the plan must have been for Wells to be en route somewhere else when the bomb detonated? Seems too unpredictable and not long enough a time to determine where he'd be and pick up the money before anyone noticed a dead guy I'd think, especially if he were driving or walking in a populated area. Wouldn't it have been better to not time the bomb and simply detonate it manually when he met back up with them? Or set it for like an hour and a half and then send him to a remote are and tell him they'd meet him there and then not show until after detonation time. I don't know, just doesn't seem like they chose the easiest solution

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]7LBoots 5 points 4 years ago 
The police held him up because they thought he put the bomb on himself, that there were no kidnappers making him do it, and that he would never detonate it. They didn't know then about the accomplices. In any case, it was a stupid plan because they were idiots, not experts. I doubt they would have thought that far ahead.

June and Jennifer Gibbons.

The twin sisters were inseparable and had speech impediments that made it difficult for people outside their immediate family to understand them. As a result, they mixed very little with other children and were ostracized at school. This proved traumatic for the twins, eventually causing their school administrators to dismiss them early each day so that they might avoid bullying. Their language became even more idiosyncratic at this time. Soon it was unintelligible to others.

The girls had a long agreement that if one died, the other must begin to speak and live a normal life. During their stay in the hospital, they began to believe that it was necessary for one twin to die, and after much discussion, Jennifer agreed to be the sacrifice. In March 1993, the twins were transferred from Broadmoor to the more open Caswell Clinic in Bridgend, Wales; on arrival Jennifer could not be roused. She was taken to the hospital where she died soon after of acute myocarditis, a sudden inflammation of the heart. There was no evidence of drugs or poison in her system, and her death remains a mystery. On a visit a few days later, Wallace recounted that June "was in a strange mood. She said, 'I'm free at last, liberated, and at last Jennifer has given up her life for me.'"

I think I've mentioned this in a similar thread in the past, but I'm going to go with the Bath School disaster. It happened in Michigan in 1927, and to this day it's still the deadliest mass killing in an American school.

The story starts with a 54-year-old farmer named Andrew Kehoe. Kehoe was by all accounts a frugal (some would say stingy) man, and even though he wasn't well-liked by his neighbors, his reputation for thrift allowed him to be elected as treasurer of the Bath County school board, and for a brief time as the township's clerk as well. He lost a 1926 election for the clerk position, however, after running on a campaign that emphasized low property taxes, and at that point he seems to have decided that he would perform an act of revenge against the citizens who had made it possible for the government to take away his hard-earned money.

Starting that August, he gradually purchased several hundred pounds of both dynamite and a military surplus explosive called pyrotol, buying small quantities at numerous stores in the surrounding area in order to avoid suspicion. Under the guise of performing electrical work for the school district, he concealed these explosives inside the brick schoolhouse that held all of the district's children. His preparations were so involved that he entirely stopped working on his farm, and paying his mortgage. That December, he also purchased a rifle.

In May of 1927, Kehoe put his plan into action. He killed his wife, who was terminally ill with tuberculosis and had just been discharged from the hospital, and concealed her body inside a wheelbarrow in his farm's chicken coop, then surrounded it with all of his money and other earthly valuables, in order that they could be destroyed together. He then set about systematically sabotaging everything on his farm: cutting the wire on all his fences to render it unusable, killing the trees that shaded it, slicing through all of his grape vines at the root and then wiring the stems back into place so that nothing would seem amiss to a casual observer, and placing massive firebombs inside every structure on the farm. He also used wire restraints to hobble the legs of his two horses inside his barn, to prevent them from escaping from it once the bombs went off, and filled his truck with large quantities of explosives and metal shrapnel. Finally, he started a fire inside his home, and when the volunteer fire brigade arrived, he rode off and told them that they should leave, as they were his friends and they would soon be needed at the school.

At 8:45 that morning, fifteen minutes after the start of classes, an alarm clock that Kehoe had rigged as a detonator triggered the explosives he had concealed inside the north wing of the schoolhouse. A similar device in the south wing failed to activate, but the result of the one successful explosion was more than bad enough. In an instant, the entire north wing of the schoolhouse lifted several feet into the air, and community members miles away were jostled by the shockwave. Burning children were thrown through the windows of their classrooms, and the roof collapsed on top of those still inside. A local resident named Monte Ellsworth who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter described it thus: "There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof."

The efforts of more than a hundred frantic men were not enough to lift the roof off of the children, so Ellsworth volunteered to go home to his farm and get a thick rope that could be used to drag it off of them. On his way there, he passed his neighbor Kehoe on road. Kehoe favored him with a big smile and a cheerful wave.

When Kehoe arrived at the scene, he beckoned the school superintendent (whom he hated) over to his carriage. Witnesses saw the two struggling over Kehoe's gun, and then Kehoe fired a shot that triggered the bomb inside his carriage, spraying shrapnel into the crowd of rescuers and instantly killing both himself and his rival.

Eventually, the townspeople were able to clear enough of the wreckage to remove and treat all of the children who were still alive. They also discovered the second timer, and the more than 500 pounds of explosives that it was meant to detonate. You can see a picture of them here.

In total, Kehoe killed 43 people that day: his wife, the superintendent, four bystanders who were too close to the truck bomb (including an eight-year-old boy who had escaped from the first explosion), and 38 people who had been inside the school, all but two of whom were children between the ages of seven and fourteen. 58 others were seriously injured. Kehoe's body was claimed by his sister, and secretly buried in an unmarked grave. The only explanation he left behind was a sign wired to a fence post at his farm - it read, "Criminals are made, not born."

Whenever I think about the Bath School disaster, I'm always taken aback by Kehoe's behavior. It's one thing to just snap in anger - while that's terrible, it's at least something you can understand on one level or another. But for more than half a year, Kehoe lived among these people, made small talk with them, and tipped his hat in the street, knowing that soon he would do his best to take all their children from them in one terrible morning of blood and fire. And as if that weren't enough, the sheer spite on display in every detail of his actions is just breathtaking. He went well out of his way to ensure that nothing he left behind would be of any use to anyone from that point forward. The horses didn't tax his land, but because someone might ride them after he was gone, they had to die. The vines didn't hurt his pride, but because they might nourish someone after he was gone, they had to die. He methodically sowed everything in his life with salt, and even his own death ensured that the survivors would gain no understanding or closure from his passing.

(Be advised that the Ellsworth book is one of the saddest goddamn things you'll ever read, as a big chunk of it is short biographies (many with photos) of the kids who were injured or killed.

Example:

Donald J. Huffman, born July 10, 1917, at Longley, Ohio, was in the fourth grade.

Both legs were broken and one leg had a compound fracture. His arm was broken at the wrist. About half of his right cheek bone was cracked and had to be taken off. His whole cheek from above his ear was torn loose and just hanging on one side so his teeth and eyeball could be seen. His eye was lacerated badly, but now it is healed so you can only see a portion of his eye in the corner next to his nose, then there is a cataract growing over that. He is blind in that eye. Donald was cut in many other places, mostly on the back. He was unconscious for ten days and there were no hopes for him for over two weeks. The doctors say that he was the most cut and bruised of any child in the school, dead or alive.

Donald gets nearly hysterical when it storms. He says he does not want to go back to school again for fear someone will dynamite him. He is in the hospital at this date, August 10, 1927, but expects to be home soon. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel B. Huffman.

So, anyway, caveat emptor.)

He survived until 2011, and died at the ripe old age of 93. Here's his obituary. It says that he had a wife named Helen, a friend named Todd, and a dog named P.D., so maybe his life wasn't all bad.

You can hear him talking a bit about the disaster at this link, as part of a short interview recorded in 2009.

No, I just ran across the story one day, and it really stuck with me. I had been reading a piece about the Collinwood school fire (which is a huge tear-jerker in and of itself, and an important event that led to big changes in fire codes and building design), and it included a passing reference to the disaster at Bath.

Mr. Huffman I only looked up this morning - I wrote that post and then like you, I wondered what had happened to the sad little boy in the photo. It's just a coincidence that so much information about him happened to be readily available.

[–]Wiki_FirstPara_bot 6 points 4 years ago 
First para from Wikipedia article Collinwood school fire:

The Collinwood school fire (also known as the Lake View School fire) of Ash Wednesday, March 4, 1908, was one of the deadliest disasters of its type in the United States. 172 students, two teachers and a rescuer were killed in the conflagration in Collinwood, Ohio, a community that has since been absorbed into the city of Cleveland.

And all for property. All for things.

Notice that he was quite a prosperous farmer? Well set for life? And yet he was willing to kill everyone he could because they forced him to give a small amount of that prosperity to the government. Because other people were much less important than his right to keep his own property.

[–]unepomme 5 points 4 years ago 
No it's textbook narcissistic sociopathy. It's way beyond greed. It seems to me he was pissed at a perceived slight from the town's people (probably being rejected personally and/or his political ideas being rejected- narcissists have a hard time believing their ideas are fallable which can lead to misanthropic feelings when they're rejected by others) and had decided he had lost too much of his status in life (lost election, terminal wife, maybe other unknown issues) to want to continue living. So instead of committing suicide quietly, he decides to 'give those fuckers what they deserve' and to do it on such a scale as bring some serious notoriety to himself and his ideas. I blame the victims for making me do this- its the classic narcissistic antisocial bully. This is probably what's behind most school shooting type scenarios.

I don't think there's a complete lack of understanding in the case. It's totally twisted and fucked up, but he felt he had a message, and people will do crazy shit if they think their message is important enough.

"Criminals are made, not born" could have meant that the town brought this upon themselves, just solidifying Kehoe as a real greedy bastard. The other potential interpretation of the message is to have people acknowledge the presence of evil. Maybe he wanted something that people couldn't have closure or understanding of. Something cruel, without reasoning, and all in all, evil.

Surprised not to see this here already:

A man named Richard Parker is a character in a book:

In 1838, Poe's only novel was published - The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Partway through the book, the crew of a ship called Grampus finds themselves with a busted boat and no food or water. They manage to catch a tortoise and strip off its shell, but eventually, in order to survive, the crew draws straws to figure out which of them will be sacrificed to provide meat for everyone else. The death straw goes to a former mutineer named Richard Parker, who is promptly stabbed to death; his head, hands and feet thrown overboard (you can read the whole grisly thing here). This keeps the floating Donner Party alive a little bit longer, but the two remaining crew members are still on the brink of death when they're finally rescued.

40 years later, this happens:

....

In 1884, a yacht named the Mignonette left England, headed toward Sydney, Australia.

The yacht wasn't really made for trips around the world, so it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone when it sank in a storm. The four-man crew barely escaped in a lifeboat, but they definitely didn't have enough provisions for survival. They did catch a turtle and eat it, but just like their counterparts in the 45-year-old Poe tale, they needed more if they were going to be found alive when a rescue boat found them.

One man - a 17-year-old named Richard Parker - fell overboard and then made the mistake of drinking seawater to attempt to quench his thirst. Parker started going downhill fast, and that's when his fellow survivors decided they would kill him to ensure their own survival. The men had considered drawing straws, but they figured Parker was so far gone they might as well kill him and drink his blood while it was fresh (instead of risking the contaminated blood that might occur if they just waited for him to die due to illness). After stabbing Parker in the throat with a penknife, the three men devoured him. They were rescued a few days later.

The ensuing prosecution of the four men is considered a landmark case and precedent, and is taught in first-year law school to this day, both for its legal importance and its grisly ick factor.

Essentially, the Court found that necessity was no defense for cannibalism under the law, and that the men were guilty of murder and cannibalism - the heinousness of the crime supersedes the exigencies of necessity.

The precedent has been partially overturned in some jurisdictions.

An opportunity to offer a fresh test of the rule in full has yet to materialise.

It's funny, we studied the trial of the captain of the second story in criminal law. A whole debate on whether there was intent to kill, and fault for the young man's death. The captain was pardoned, but there was strong evidence for at least a manslaughter conviction because the captain had reason to know that the ship wasn't sea worthy (he decided to sail the dilapidated boat, instead of using part of his commission to get it fixed up first).

The Poe story would have made the whole thing more interesting.

This is actually a legal case we learned about in Criminal Law over here! The case is called R v Dudley and Stephens and was an important case in deciding whether the defence of necessity could ever be used when charged with murder, which the judges held could not be the case. It's a fairly long and arduous judgement but they were both found guilty of murder and sentenced to death before being granted an official pardon by Queen Victoria and serving just 6 months imprisonment. Still, a pretty unfortunate thing to happen, especially for poor Mr. Parker.

To add to the story, the men went on trial for murder once they were rescued and all they had to do was lie but one of them chose to tell the truth about what happened and they received the death penalty as a result.

The Avett Brothers named an album after this ship and in the insert had a summary of this story. I always took it to be a statement about being honest and true at all costs.

I know a few people with relatives gone missing there. Mostly Native women. Robert Pickton was charged for the murders of some missing women. He apparently fed them to his pigs. Such a sad sad area. There is so much distance between the cities on that highway. People are always hitch-hiking from cities like Prince George and travelling to Vancouver. I only hope that it stops and many of the families affected by the Highway of Tears can find closure one day.

Edit: I don't know much about the Robert Pickton case but it did involve many missing women. Yet I found out about another guy linked to the missing women from the highway of tears http://www.vancouversun.com/news/RCMP+believe+there+more+than+Highway+Tears+killer/7297179/story.html .

PoCo is serviced by the RCMP though and the Highway of Tears team, established in 2005 (a couple of years after the Pickton excavations ended and just before trial began) is run out of the lower mainland.

The specific shuffling of police claim is one I heard from a professor that was heavily involved in activism around the Highway when I lived up north. They were particularly concerned that several investigators with in-depth knowledge of the cases had been yanked to focus on Pickton. I wish I could provide more substantive information than that.

Indeed it does, but I imagine it's a bit of a trade off - might not be able to convince the number/quality of investigators it deserves to live in Smithers or Prince George, but on the other hand you lose the regional ties that can be beneficial to a case like this.

Her remains were among those found on picktons farm, my uncle was inhis early twenties and I was quite young when he went to the trial.

I'm not sure that would provide a lot of info for anyone, my uncle didn't know much about his mother and was contacted through extended family he had not met before going to the trial. It's quote painful for him to talk about, he only knew his mother as a murder victim so I could imagine he would not be interested. There were so many families affected and more closely connected to the trials that could probably be willing and more able to provide information, I would even be interested in an ama from someone like that. I'm sure If you made an ama request someone would answer. Picktons trial and conviction was something that shook the province, it was huge, especially for the communities located around highway 16, the lower mainland and the southern interior. Since a lot of people used him as an example of what happens to hitch hikers especially since the towns are spread so far apart, even though i dont think all of his victims were taken whilst on the highway. Hitchhiking is illegal and strictly enforced still in most of the province.

I grew up very close to his farm in Port Moody B.C. He was a community involved man, which was very creepy.

I was just saying there was a link. Distance doesn't stop people from killing in other areas. People still are going missing. Madison Scott a girl from Vanderhoof went missing a couple years ago. Flyers and billboards are up all over the place. Unfortunately many of the missing women's families don't have the finances to make billboards and such to bring it to every bodies attention. A guy from Fort Saint James BC was purportedly to have killed a few women and he was caught in Alberta http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-man-accused-of-being-serial-killer-1.1080350 . I know of a few people that went to school with him. Some creepy shit happens in Fort St. James sometimes like http://www.pgfreepress.com/four-arrested-in-connection-with-fribjon-bjornson-murder/ I knew his room-mate and the people accused. I heard rumours of what happened in surprising detail. Many people there knew what was going on. These communities are small. There is lots of alcohol, drug abuse and gang affiliations in this area. People don't trust the police and it hinders the justice system greatly. Yet some of the police here don't make it easy with all the accusations of rape and overall crookedness.

First paragraph from wiki:

Highway 16 is the British Columbia, Canada, section of the Yellowhead Highway. The highway closely follows the path of the northern B.C. alignment of the Canadian National Railway. The number "16" was first given to the highway in 1942, and originally, the route that the highway took was more to the north of today's highway, and it was not as long as it is now. Highway 16 originally ran from New Hazelton east to an obscure location known as Aleza Lake. In 1947, Highway 16's western end was moved from New Hazelton to the coastal city of Prince Rupert, and in 1953, the highway was extended all the way east into Yellowhead Pass. Highway 16's alignment on the Haida Gwaii was commissioned in 1984, with BC Ferries beginning service along Highway 16 to the Haida Gwaii the following year.

Willie Pickton and Clifford Olsen were both from Port Coquitlam, a suburb of Vancouver.

One a notorious serial killer of Vancouver sex trade workers from the downtown East side. He was convicted of 7 murders. The creepy part is how he disposed of the bodies. He fed them to his pigs, which caused a massive scare in Vancouver as he sold his pigs to be sold to Safeway grocery chains.

More that the humans who were not ultra smart (for the time) nor cooperative basically had no chance, and those that had those traits survived and eventually thrived. It was a cull of humans in epic proportions. Everyone alive today shares genes with the 1,000-10,000 breeding pairs that survived that event, and while we did go on to become the dominant form because of those traits, I don't think that was guaranteed by it.

You're talking about the Toba catastrophe as if it veritably happened, when it is more likely that it didn't. There is plenty of evidence that runs contrary to the theory.

Seeing as that there is evidence the local populations of humans in the areas near Toba survived the eruption, I seriously doubt that the eruption would have killed off the vast majority of humans on the planet.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

Not saying that there isn't plenty of evidence that runs contrary to the theory, but it isn't a hypothesis. The event occurred and now you're weighing the amount of effect it had. Something bottlenecked the population and that could have been any number of things, true. It just happens to be that this event occurs at about exactly the same time. The largest super eruption in the last 2.5 million years.

Not saying that there isn't plenty of evidence that runs contrary to the theory, but it isn't a hypothesis.

I don't understand your point. A theory just means there is a certain amount of compelling evidence to support the hypothesis. That doesn't mean the theory is true. If there is contradicting evidence, then that theory is subject to criticism which is what I was partaking in.

It just happens to be that this event occurs at about exactly the same time.

You should do some research into the human population bottle-necking. The Wikipedia article is a good start. There is no solid consensus on the time range of the bottle neck, with some earlier estimates figuring the event to have occurred 70,000 years ago, and recent ones saying it happened 2 million years ago, and that more recent supposed events of human bottle-necking don't follow the evidence. This is an extremely complicated issue, after all.

If you're going to pick a less reputable publication than wikipedia, huffingtonpost is probably a good one.

This is fallacious. It doesn't matter if the article was posted at Wikipedia or Huffington post, what matter are the citations the article is using. The Huffington Post article is a reporting of the same article at livescience. Furthermore, this isn't Huffington Post's analysis, and they never claim responsibility for the research. It is also a sourced article.

"We have been able to show that the largest volcanic eruption of the last two million years did not significantly alter the climate of East Africa," said researcher Christine Lane, a geologist at the University of Oxford.

Just because Huffington Post publishes or republishes something does not make it wrong.

It seems as if you're trying to claim that modern levels of intelligence came about in our species because of this super eruption. That would be a specious argument (pardon me whilst I congratulate myself on my clever word use).

I remind you that the aboriginal people of Australia had left Africa as a distinct breeding population and were 10,000 to 20,000 years on their way to Indonesia by that time. How many of them were in their own bottleneck? How big was their own individual bottleneck and how many breeding pairs should we reduce the modern Caucasian, Asian and African bottle neck by to account for them?

Actually, come to think of it, were the ancestors of the modern Asians already migrated out of Africa? What was their individual bottleneck? How about the Caucasians?

Not to mention that four separate species of human survived this event. Not the least of which was homo floresiensis, endemic to the Indonesian isle from whence their name comes.

Archaeologists who in 2013 found a microscopic layer of glassy volcanic ash in sediments of Lake Malawi, and definitively linked the ash to the 75,000-year-old Toba super-eruption, went on to note a complete absence of finding the change in fossil type close to the ash layer that would be expected following a severe volcanic winter. This result led the archaeologists to conclude that the largest known volcanic eruption in the history of the human species did not significantly alter the climate of East Africa.

While such an eruption would be heavily catastrophic, I don't think it is remotely an existential threat to the human species anymore.

Actually I don't think you understand what I meant: 120,000 years ago humanity was almost wiped out as well. We came back stronger. 75,000 years ago we were reduced to a population of 20,000 or so. After that we took over the planet.

See the thing about extinction events is typically the survivors do so because they are resistant to the executioner. Like if you had a race of bugs in various shades of grey, if a forest fire swept through the darker bugs would be more likely to survive because they'd blend in better with the ash. Or after the black plague ended, the majority of the survivors were resistant or immune to it. So something in that extinction event wiped out not just us, but also competitors that could have prevented us from spreading out from Africa.

Conversely, insects can't build biological weaponry capable of wiping out entire species unlike human beings. Furthermore they lack the thought process to ever declare war, so if we decided we didn't want there to be insects anymore, we could severely reduce their number.

Not that we would, it'd be stupid and take an incredible amount of time and resources, but we COULD. Whereas insects literally CANT wipe out humans. Thats not to say they lack the means, just that they lack the basic intellect to even consider that kind of goal.

Seems like this is only a theory and has a lot of evidence against it. The eruption definitely happened, but the decrease in human population because of it is debatable.

For example: " ancient stone tools in southern India were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the Toba eruption and were very similar across these layers, suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population. Additional archaeological evidence from southern and northern India also suggests a lack of evidence for effects of the eruption on local populations, leading the authors of the study to conclude, "many forms of life survived the supereruption, contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks"."

It does say that the plant life was really affected and because of this, Humans had to adapt and come up with different survival strategies.

[–]kidneytheif 1 point 4 years ago 
Other research has cast doubt on the genetic bottleneck theory. For example, ancient stone tools in southern India were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the Toba eruption and were very similar across these layers, suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population.[36][37][38] Additional archaeological evidence from southern and northern India also suggests a lack of evidence for effects of the eruption on local populations, leading the authors of the study to conclude, "many forms of life survived the supereruption, contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks".[39] However, evidence from pollen analysis has suggested prolonged deforestation in South Asia, and some researchers have suggested that the Toba eruption may have forced humans to adopt new adaptive strategies, which may have permitted them to replace Neanderthals and "other archaic human species".[40] This has been challenged by evidence for the presence of Neanderthals in Europe and Homo floresiensis in Southeastern Asia who survived the eruption by 50,000 and 60,000 years, respectively.[41]

The story of Grigori Rasputin and the circumstances of his death.

It goes roughly like this. Rasputin was a very large man standing 6' 4" (1.93 m) and was a sort of adviser to the royal Romanav family of Russia. He repeatedly healed their fragile hemophiliac son, or so it is reported. He never really belonged to any specific sect per se, but was said to be a holy man. Many rumored him to be an agent of the devil or some possessed being. Pictures of the dude are creepy.

Anyway, among political strife and rumors that Rasputin was seeking more power he was ordered to be killed. He was given a nice meal laced with enough poison to kill several men. After a while with no reaction they promptly shot him in the back. Rasputin fell, but regained his strength and attacked his assailants. He was shot again in the head, and beaten vigorously. They then wrapped him up and threw him in the Niva river. Later it was discovered that Rasputin had attempted to claw out of the ice and finally drowned.

This guy, rumored to have supernatural powers along being very large and creepy, survived thorough poisoning, shots to the back and head, beaten and thrown in the river, and finally drowned under the ice.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. It should be mentioned that historians are not 100% sure how it happened and most agree that some of it simply isn't true.

In case anyone is confused it's Moscau by Dschinghis Khan from 1979.

According to Wikipedia: "The song also achieved an enormous underground popularity in the Soviet Union. A 15 second clip of the song's performance was shown as a part of the New Year holiday lineup on the state-run TV, leading to the immediate dismissal of the network's director."

It's also on Just Dance 2014.

Just so you know, I went to the Russian Museum of Erotica just to see Rasputin's penis. The Erotica Museum is pretty much just a hodge-podge collection of antique Spenser Gift's type trinkets. THE IMPORTANT PART IS that it's also an operating VD clinic. With real patients and doctors and nurses performing STD checks.

Most people that drown in cold water don't have any water in their lungs. We have a reflex called the mammalian diving reflex that more or less closes our airway to the lungs when your face is submerged in cold water. That feeling you get in your throat when you go into cold water? That's it. If you don't surface and get your face out of the cold water, your throat won't reopen. You'll die and your throat will remain closed. If you die and then get thrown in cold water, there will be water in your lungs.

Next time you're getting a bj, you need to warm up her throat with some encouraging gentle massage. This will actually cause the throat muscles to relax, allowing you to go deeper. Then, when you feel the time is right, reach under your bed for that hidden bag of ice and quickly wrap it around her neck! Faster than you can say "Wasn't that a delightful gag?!" her mammalian diving reflex will have trapped your member in her throat.

What about the gasp reflex?

Better source, though more reading

"Even with your head above water, a splash of cold water in your face from a boat’s wake as it cruises by you can cause you to involuntarily inhale water, which is a killer. Not swallowing in down your throat into your stomach but inhaling it into your lungs. This is the “gasp reflex.” "

perma-linksaveparent

[–]DrLiamSeuss 5 points 4 years ago 
The gasp reflex won't be triggered underwater. It is specific to a situation with an unobstructed mouth.

Holding your breath, for a sufficient amount of time, will usually end with gasping for air. If your mouth happens to be covered, you shouldn't trigger a gasp reflex.

I was unable to pull a good source, but did attempt to confirm it by self experimentation.

Oh so THAT’S what that is. I have a heart condition and when I’m having a bit of an episode one remedy is to plunge my face in cold water. Every time I do it I try and breath air through my nose, but I can only do it for a split second before my body just stops doing it.

Happens in all water, though usually at a chance of around 10%. The throat closes to prevent drowning, and asphyxiates you. Usually called dry drowning, as opposed to wet (lungs filled with external water) or secondary (lungs filled with water from your body as a reaction to inhaling a small amount, usually happens after the initial incident).

Not necessarily, I misspoke a little. It's an overreaction of the mammalian diving reflex, often caused by stress. So maybe if you were walking along a boat and suddenly in cold water it might happen, but it isn't 100%.

Just to freak you out again it relatively common for the throat to remain closed even when the person is pulled from the water. So you have to wait until the muscles relax before pushing air into them will work in CPR

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Hristix 1 point 4 years ago 
Actually water filling your lungs is pretty peaceful. The urge to breathe is caused by buildup of carbon dioxide in your blood, not by lack of oxygen. Water in your lungs means that you're still getting rid of carbon dioxide. So you wouldn't feel much urge to breathe after the initial shock. Then it's all peaceful, straight to the grave.

Cold water drowning with your throat closing would mean you're panicking and flailing in abject horror for a few minutes as it felt like your chest and face were on fire.

How do they actually die? Lack of oxygen? Their body doesn't gasp or breathe when they pass out?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Hristix 1 point 4 years ago 
Two ways you can die. Buildup of carbon dioxide is what causes the urge to breathe like when you hold your breath, and if you can't get it out of your blood, it can acidify your blood and kill you...but that's more of a long term thing (>10 minutes). Lack of oxygen is what normally would kill you, as it would usually take less than ten minutes...cold water increases that time somewhat, but that still kills you faster.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]dano8801 1 point 4 years ago 
Do you not gasp as you lose consciousness after a minute or two without taking a breath?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Hristix 1 point 4 years ago 
It just depends. There's a lot of reasons you can stop breathing. The respiratory center in your brain is connected to various chemical receptors in the brain and other parts of the body to tell what the CO2 level is, and some indirect ways of measuring oxygenation. Trauma to the brain stem will cause one kind of abnormal respiration, while asphyxiation might cause another, and heart attacks can cause still more. So it really just depends.

This isn't entirely true. When I was an observer on alaskan fishing boats they would coach us to cover our mouths when we jumped into water if we were ever forced to bail from a boat because the extreme cold would make us reflexively gasp for air. And having jumped into the Bering Sea off the coast I can attest to the reflex.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Hristix 1 point 4 years ago 
Stress is a part of it. It isn't EXACTLY part of the diving reflex, more of an overreaction by the body. So them telling you to cover your mouth made it less stressful because it wasn't entirely uncharted territory, so to speak.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]cam18_2000 1 point 4 years ago 
Not exactly true, though this may happen occasionally for the most part the build up of carbon dioxide in your blood causes that pain you feel when you hold your breath, eventually that pain becomes unbarable and people try to inhale, putting water into their lungs.

I participated in a Mud Run (one of those marine obstacle course things) a couple years ago. It was in the spring and not warm at all. One of the obstacles is to jump into water and swim about 50 feet. The water was really cold and I jumped in and my throat promptly closed up. Most terrifying thing ever. I couldn't breathe, even when I tried to get on my back to "relax" and open my lungs up. But nope. I had to swim over to the side, pull myself up on the wall out of the water so my throat could relax. And then I just took a deep breath and got back in, and that was my only breath for the swim. Never doing that obstacle again.

Is suffocating a worse sensation than drowning? i.e. would dying in frigid water be more pleasant than dying in water tepid enough that the MDR doesn't kick in?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Hristix 1 point 4 years ago 
A lot of people find drowning to be quite peaceful after the initial 'oh shit I'm drowning' response wears off. The urge to breathe (like when you hold your breath and feel that stress/tension telling you to breathe) is actually caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, rather than a lack of oxygen. If there's water in your lungs, the carbon dioxide can still dissolve out, but you don't really get any oxygen.

However, if your throat had closed, it'd be a gasping/clawing/stressful death more than likely as the carbon dioxide couldn't escape.

Interestingly, a lot of people with breathing problems don't die from lack of oxygen, they die because they can't get the carbon dioxide out of their blood well enough and it turns acidic.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]fvdcsxaz 1 point 4 years ago 
I'm not sure I understand this. It sounds like what you're saying is when you submerge your face in cold water, your throat closes, meaning you can't breathe - even if you wanted to? If that's the case, SCUBA divers/snorkelers wouldn't be able to breathe.

Also I found no reference to throat-closing on the wikipedia entry for this. Maybe I'm just not getting something.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Wiki_FirstPara_bot 1 point 4 years ago 
First para from linked Wikipedia article Mammalian diving reflex:

The mammalian diving reflex is a reflex in mammals which optimizes respiration to allow staying underwater for extended periods of time. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins, etc.), but exists in a weaker version in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. Every animal's diving reflex is triggered specifically by cold water contacting the face – water that is warmer than 21 °C (70°F) does not cause the reflex, and neither does submersion of body parts other than the face. Also, the reflex is always exhibited more dramatically, and thus can grant longer survival, in young individuals.

I think the technical term for it is laryngospasm. It tends to happen more often when someone is stressed/shocked whenever they enter the water. It can happen in warm water too, but is much much more common in cold water. It's part of an overreaction of the diving reflex, rather than being a part of it functioning normally. It can actually be triggered just by washing your face with cold water.

You can drown and have no water in your lungs, it's called 'dry drowning'. Official cause of death was a bullet to the head.

I am not ashamed to admit that I don't understand why the term "dry drowning" exists. I'd never heard it before today. Is that not just suffocation, or am I missing something? I'm genuinely curious.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]MrsJingo 3 points 4 years ago 
There are a few different types of dry drowning. The one I know most about is 'laryngospasm' which is common with GERDs (gastroesophageal reflux disease). As soon as your voice box or the area of the windpipe below the voicebox detect the entry of water or other liquid, the vocal folds spasm shut. The lack of oxygen causes hypoxia, and the increased carbon dioxide causes acidosis. I don't think laryngospasm is often fatal but it certainly can be.

[–]colovick 2 points 4 years ago 
A guy higher up explained it... mammals have a reflex to close off their airway when the face is submerged in cold water, so if you're alive before being thrown into the water, you still suffocate from lack of oxygen, but you don't inhale water because your airway was sealed at the time of death

I thought they had laced cake batter with poison but in the process of actually baking it, the poison was unintentionally denatured or burned out.

[–]MrsJingo 3 points 4 years ago 
The only 'solid' fact is, there was no poison in his system.

2 people who knew him claimed he wouldn't have eaten the food. One of the co-conspirators said he didn't eat it which is why they were forced to shoot him. The other co-conspirators claimed he ate the food but didn't die because he was some kind of monster.

The poison may have been ruined by the cooking or he may not have eaten it but either way he certainly wasn't poisoned by it.

Just to elaborate: Rasputin cured the tsar's son from haemophilia, a disease where his blood wouldn't clot when he started to bleed. Rasputin did nothing but holding the doctors away from the tsar's son. Those doctors where fond of the newly invented the aspirin which, as we know now, works blood thinning. The disease cured by itself after a while, like it does most of the time.

This won Rasputin the tsar's confidence. Especially his wife liked Rasputin so much because they thought he had magical powers. He stayed with the tsar as personal advisor. He had as much friends as he had enemies, but among the enemies where some Russian generals who thought his influence was gettig to big, so they tried to kill him.

Haemophilia is an incurable (as far as I'm aware, maybe bone marrow transplants or something?) genetic condition. Alexei's symptoms and bleeds were alleviated by his escape from aspirin and whatever else. But I'm being pedantic.

That's not completely true. It was a British Secret Service agent that shot him. The British Government thought Rasputin was trying to convince the Russian royal family to sign an armistice with Germany, which would allow Germany to focus its military strength on the western front, which in turn could have been detrimental to the British war effort. Therefore, the forerunner to MI6 had one of their agents, Oswald Rayner, do the dead with the help of Prince Yusupov. They invited Rasputin for tea, lured him to the basement, and Rayner shot him. The bullets (there were at least four) were found to have come from a Webley revolver, the standard issue gun given to British spies working in Russia at the time. After that they threw his already dead body into the river.

The reason the poison had no effect was because they laced the bread with it before baking it, simply baking the poison out. There was nothing left web Rasputin ate it. That prince Yusipov shot him afterwards and he didn't die, well that is a whole other story...

Thanks for bringing up that detail; I was always fascinated by the Rasputin story, but despite my disappointment in the story not being as shocking as initially presented, I'd rather know the truth than be delighted by the myth.

That said, I just looked at his wikipedia entry, and it's now suggested he didn't actually eat anything due to an aversion to sugar. He also likely died from a bullet wound to the head early in the assassination, and that the water in the lungs thing isn't particularly significant. It's tough to say; the main account of the murder was clearly embellished by the perpetrators, and considering how hard it is now to get a straight story out of Russia, I imagine people will continue to speculate as to what happened for years to come. To some extent, I'm now more fascinated by the uncertainty...

Hasn't this largely been debunked? The only records of it happening this way are by the murderers themselves who wanted to portray Rasputin as a monster. In fact one if the accounts state that he didn't eat any of the poisoned food at all and pathologists believed he died shortly after being shot and was most likely thrown into the river afterwards. It's a shame too, I always loved this story about Rasputin being ridiculously difficult to kill.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Killfile 2 points 4 years ago 
Historians differ on the accuracy of the account of Rasputin's death. While to our modern ear it makes him sound like an unimaginable badass, the story of Rasputin's death comes to us mostly through his killers who, understandably, didn't like the guy or his politics.

In depicting Rasputin as somehow immune to poison, stabbing, shooting, bludgeoning, etc they portray him as supernatural -- perhaps demonic -- and his death by drowning fits well into that kind of mythology.

So while it's possible that Rasputin really was among the hardest people in recorded history to kill, its somewhat more likely that he was the victim of a botched poisoning, finished off by a revolver, dumped in the Niva, and then -- like many things pulled from a river -- the subject of exaggeration and self-serving fictions.

I've read a lot of research on ballistics and the effects of bullets on the human body. It's absolutely amazing how many places you have where a bullet can slip right through and not damage anything important. There are even more places where it will kill you, but not for the next day or two.

It's actually fairly common to have bullets bounce off the skull or large bones as well, especially pistol bullets in small calibers.

I read of one gunfight where the first hint the cop had that someone was shooting at him was when he got shot in the face. He just thought he'd been punched until he felt that his teeth were sideways in his mouth. He returned fire, hit the guy in a major artery on his first shot. It was a mortal wound, but the suspect fired another five shots before the cop wrestled him to the ground and finished him. The cop survived.

So, anyway, doesn't necessarily take anything creepy for that story to be true, just some lucky trajectories.

Don't forget that during his cremation he was said to have come back to life. His corpse was said to have leaped out of the fire while it was a flame.

While many people at the time thought he had risen himself from the dead due to his supernatural powers, more modern thinking suggests that in their haste to burn his body, they didn't prepare his body adequately for cremation. So when they started to burn him, all of his ligaments seized up and became rigid, effectively making him sit up with his arms and legs raised out and move around.

Modern writers, using newly available Bolshevik and Soviet-era official documents, claim that the post-mortem found no trace of poison, and that Rasputin died simply of gunshot wounds. He was no harder to kill than any other mortal, and stories of him repeatedly rising from the dead that night originate solely with his killers-who were merely trying to turn a squalid murder into an act of demon-slaying heroism

since this didnt happen germany funded lenin with insanely high amounts of money to start the soviet revolution, thinking they would put a puppet into power which then makes peace.

but lenin had no intention of playing the puppet and funded the german worker revolution instead, which led to formation of the weimarer republic and made hitlers rise to power possible, along with ww2 and the cold war.

A couple details I remembered hearing was that he happened to do arsenic as a drug thus bolstering his immunity. That is what they poisoned him with.

Also when I heard it told originally, they cut off his head arms and legs, and the way I heard it there was water in his lungs meaning his lungs were still breathing after having his limbs and head removed.

My favorite history lesson, even better than the defenestration of Prague.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Pretty_Little_Shit 1 point 4 years ago 
I actually did a research paper on the guy a while ago, and the reasons behind some of his surviving is just as amazing. It's believed that with arsenic, he used immurement, which is systematically giving yourself small amounts of poison in order to build an immunity for it. This man had enough foresight to realize that people would try to do this shit to him.

I have no fucking idea how he survived the shots, though.

An interesting part though, is that when he was burned after death for cremation, he appeared to try to stand up after being shot, being poisoned, being cold, and being thrown in the river. The priest who was burning him saw him fucking move, only adding to the rumors that he's terrifying. The reason for this is that the priest was inexperienced, and didn't cut the tendons, which when heated caused it to bend, making it look like a body was actually moving.

Interestingly enough, he supposedly cured the Romanov son through hypnotism. The reason that they believed that this worked had something to do with the fact that hemophilia prevents blood from coagulating, but hypnotism (whether effective at convincing people to do things or not) has the ability to relax someone immensely, making their blood flow very slowly. With the slow blood flow, the heart was pumping less to the broken skin area,which mean less would come out.

The brazen bull was a torture and execution device that basically roasted the person alive. It was a hollow brass bull with a door on the side. The victim would be locked inside. A fire was lit underneath the bull and a special design of tubes caused the steam to imitate the bellowing of a bull.

Legend has it (with some fairly convincing evidence) that the designer of the bull was locked inside to see if his creation was true to the description.

According to link:

In the head of the bull, Perilaus put a series of tubes and stops that were designed to amplify the screams of the victim and make them sound like the roar of a bull.

I thought it was the victim screaming and breathing through the tube (fresh air) that caused the bull noise.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 2 points 4 years ago 
I seem to remember that the tubes were designed so that as the air became hot and unbreathable, the victims would go to the tubes to breath and their screams would sound like a bull due to the design of the tubes. Kind of like a fucked up tuba.

The thing about that game is that you think that once you see a monster or progress in the game, it will get less scary as you become more brave.

Actually, I found that halfway through the game, the scares stopped and it became more of a sequence of "walk, look around, walk, look around, shit, hide, walk some more."

No more scares, just hiding. Although that mission in the red-misted ancient Mesoamerican ruins under the castle (?) was quite menacing

The scare factor changes. It starts off with the ambiance and occasional scare, to a lot of scares and survival, then they start to elude more to the story about who you are and what you actually did. Then it gets downright disturbing and creepy. It keeps a wonderful pace.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]josefx 3 points 4 years ago 
Still more humane compared to modern methods, but too messy compared to the slower and sometimes faulty lethal injection or the slower and sometimes faulty electric chair.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]rnbwxsprinkles 2 points 4 years ago 
I can imagine a fault electric chair, but what happens to a person in the case of faulty lethal injection? Does it kill them too slowly and they feel everything? Do they survive with horrific organ damage?

On a related note, do they anesthetize someone before using lethal injection like they do when putting an animal down?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]josefx 3 points 4 years ago 
Both the Wikipedia articles on lethal injection and on the electric chair mention problems.

For the lethal injection:

there is evidence that anaesthetics in the injection are not enough and the execute while fully paralysed is still aware and in pain.

untrained staff and sometimes hard to hit veins result in sometimes long preparation times. In at least one case it made a second injection necessary when the first failed to kill the execute after 35 minutes.

The electric chair had apparently a lot of botched uses where multiple electrocutions where necessary to kill. Some executes where found to still live only after their execution was officially over (In one case the executor had to be called back from home to address the error). This lead Nebraska to require multiple electrocutions each almost half a minute long to ensure death.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]acox1701 2 points 4 years ago 
I've honestly never understood why a lethal injection is so difficult. Grab a sedative, and give the guy 5x the 'lethal' dose.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]MyInquisitiveMind 1 point 4 years ago 
Yes, certain chemicals (eg Morphine) could be used to kill someone through overdose.

European countries ban the import of suppliers who allow any of their medication to be used in executions. Some of those restrictions extend even to a company owning a portion of another company that supplies chemicals for execution.

The market for medical morphine is drastically larger than the market for morphine used in execution.

Some of the chemicals currently used in lethal injection are very hard to come by right now as it's simply not a profitable business.

Further explanation here: http://www.npr.org/2013/10/26/241011316/lacking-lethal-injection-drugs-states-find-untested-backups

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]josefx 1 point 4 years ago 
With the amount of people surviving suicide, the lack of trained anaesthetists present mentioned by Wikipedia and their problems with basic things like finding a vein to inject into, it is unlikely that they would get that right. Also no company producing a sedative would want their product to be mentioned as the lethal component of the injection - it would be a marketing nightmare ( just as having electric chairs run on alternating and not direct current was a marketing move ).

http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Gallonio-TorturesAndTorments/text-chapter1/section12.html

Similar forms of torture may be found in plenty described in Lucian’s Dialogue entitled Lucius, or the Ass, wherein the following story is related: “We must discover,” he then said, “some sort of death whereby this maiden may endure long-drawn and bitter torment.... So let us kill this ass, and afterwards cut open its belly and after removing the inwards, shut up the girl inside in such a way that only her head be left outside (this to prevent her being entirely suffocated), while the rest of her body be hid within the carcase. Then, when this hath been sewn up, let us expose them both to the vultures—a strange meal prepared in a new and strange fashion. Now just consider the nature of this torture, I beg you. To begin with, a living woman will be shut up inside a dead ass; then by reason of the heat of the sun will she be roasted within its belly; further, she will be tormented with mortal hunger, yet entirely unable to destroy herself. Yet other features of her agony, both from the stench of the dead body as it rots, and the swarm of writhing worms, I say nothing of. Lastly, the vultures that feed on the carcase will rend in pieces the living woman at the same time. All shouted assent to this monstrous proposal, and unanimously approved its being put in execution.”

[–]whatsasnozberry 5 points 4 years ago* 
I'm sure you would have been fine if you were born in another time period :). The majority of the most gruesome methods were reserved for the absolute most heinous of criminals (a serial murderer, rapist, or someone who really pissed off the monarch). Drawing and quartering, for example, was a particularly serious punishment as the end result was devoid of a proper burial. Back then, being buried without everything intact meant the individual could not be granted salvation. The state withholding someone's afterlife wasn't used willy nilly, most people would rarely witness these punishments let alone suffer them.

Those are medieval fabrications. Look it up. The wikipedia page unfortunately repeats that falsehood. That never happened. Hell, look at the talk page for the wikipedia page on the brazen bull and you will see editors wondering why that fiction is stated as fact on the page.

At least the page admits that the Catholic church denounces such information as a fabrication. At least when it pertains to saints being killed. Because none were killed in real life that way.

Essentially two kids began filming themselves murdering people in order to sell the videos for a profit.

They killed over 21 victims and had many other related incidents. They planned on selling it to someone (potentially a group) that was very interested in snuff. Supposedly they had other murders planned.

creepiest, and most disturbing is the severed dog head that was kept alive with a machine in the 1920's. Sergei Brukhonenko kept the head of a dog alive with a primitive heart/lung machine.

With the Dog head + the heart/lung machine, you could essentially put it on another creatures body if you attached all the nerves and stuff, and have it move around, is that right?

Overnight at the Battle of Shiloh, April 6 1862. Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee. The battle to control a pivotal portion of the Mississippi River had been going all day and the fighting had been vicious and relentless. As night fell, hostilities died down. Before long a storm came along that brought a torrential downpour and lightning.

The primary sources--letters, journals, etc--that came from that night all tell a similar story: as rain poured down, lightning strikes came from the sky around midnight to light up the battlefield. The effect was to momentarily lift the darkness and let the tired soldiers see the mutilated bodies of their fallen comrades all around them. Missing limbs, parts of their skulls, lying dead or occasionally half-dead in puddles and elsewhere. Additionally there are multiple sources talking about hogs feeding on the bodies at night, a number of which were not even dead yet.

The moaning and wailing of soldiers taking their last breaths lying on a bloody battlefield in darkness as rain pours down and lightning flashes around them is something that has always stuck with me. And to think the soldiers that made it through day one knew that at the first hint of daybreak they'd be firing and be fired upon once again is just chilling.

There are so many of these stories. Some ship or plane was in the middle of the ocean and then lost contact and was never seen again. "OMG where did it go?" Into the fucking ocean. If a plane of boat "disappears" that just means we don't know exactly what part of the ocean has the corpses. Occasionally we're unsure of what dense jungle has the corpses.

The fuck did you think happened? They found the bridge to Cybertron and are partying it up with Optimus? If a plane doesn't come into an airport, what the fuck do you think is gonna happen? What is mysterious about "sometimes things crash"?

People are usually said to be missing until their bodies are found or a significant amount of time has passed. I suspect the crew would have at first been declared missing while the search went on and then declared officially dead when the were not found.

Some of that information is very likely wrong. They weren't flying to Morocco if they crashed in the Med.

A significant portion of Morocco's coastline is on the Mediterranean.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]sm9t8 4 points 4 years ago 
This is the location of the airbase that the article states they were flying to. There was no need to fly over the Med to get there from Florida.

One of the sources of the article states their destination as "undisclosed" and that they refuelled once over the Azores, and were due to refuel again off the coast of Algeria.

It just seem's highly unlikely that Morocco was their destination. They'd be flying a significant distance out of there way to refuel when they were almost there.

Mostly Atlantic, but a part of it's coast is in the Mediterranean.

But if you travel from the west Atlantic to Morocco, it doesn't make much sense to go by the Mediterranean, unless you are going to one of the northeast part of the country or are coming from the north.

That bomber pilot went crazy, utterly insane. He managed to overpower his co-pilot and steer the plane North, where he intentionally crashed it into the British RAF base in Gibraltar... The Man himself later explained to me that that pilot had been suffering from a brain tumor which, at that moment, influenced that decision.

The plane was carrying nuclear material, which was spread in the manner of a dirty bomb detonation when the plane's fuel tanks exploded and ignited a large gasoline storage tank in the base, producing a sizeable explosion. This was witnessed by the captain of a United States Forrest-Sherman-Class Destroyer which was headed out of the Mediterranian Sea at the time. Due to the distance, he could not properly ascertain the size of the explosion, but picked up the radiation of the resulting cloud of radioactive material on the ship's Geiger counter, thus making the fatal mistake of confusing the explosion for a nuclear detonation. He seems to have panicked at that point because in his message to Washington, he kept rambling about a Soviet nuclear pre-emptive strike on European military installations along the coast of the mediterranian sea. A lot of people reacted in a very rash manner in the next few hours... Long short story, after the United States started their entire strategic bomber fleet and Russian intelligence got conflicting news of a large-scale exchange between British and Russian forces in the mediterranian (which was entirely fictional and originated from an agent who was at the time suffering from delusions), World War III happened. Half of the human race did not survive the next decade.

That was the time when The Man appeared. He didn't call himself The Man, but that's what I remember, him being the first Man I had seen in a long time - damn if I can remember what he called himself... He was, that we are quite sure of, not a human being, although he physically resembled one. He talked to me personally at the time (it was 1969), trying to find out what happened to the planet. I distinctly remember him saying that 1969 was a fixed point in time that was about to be altered: A human being had to set foot on the moon on July 20, which was, at the time, impossible because we had effectively bombed ourselves back into the stone ages. The Man implied that it was possible for him to take a human being there, if neccessary, but that that was not how it was supposed to happen. He said that a particular video tape of the moon landing was what was important, one that was longer than it was supposed to be... I can not claim to understand half of it.

The Man also said that the crash of the B-47 was not a fixed point and could be altered. I would have taken him for just another nutjob then - the human race had not exactly retained its sanity after the war was over. Of course, it was never really over, but the last atomic bomb had been detonated almost eight years ago and there were about a thousand groups claiming to be the United States or the Soviet Union, fighting each other with old rifles, the occasional mortar or landmine, sticks, stones and their bruised fists.

I would have thought The Man was a madman - which was a thing he called himself, by the way - if not for his clothing. In a charred wasteland of endless war, he strolled into my little safehouse in a perfectly new, clean three-piece suit. Now, you can't know what the world was like after the bombs had fallen, but let me tell you: When I saw him entering, I truly thought the suit was a miracle. There was nothing, could be nothing as clean and undamaged in the entire world.

I don't know why I remember it all - because The Man went back. He told me he'd fix things and then he walked out again. There was a noise, then he was gone. Then there was confusion, I lost my consciousness, then I was back in my bed again and the year was 1956, the day after the war had started. Except it hadn't. I called friends and acquaintances everywhere, asked about the bombs, about the Russians and finally about the plane. It turned out that it had disappeared without a trace... They later locked me in a mental ward for a few weeks after I kept telling them about World War III, that was when I learned to shut my mouth. Hell, I stopped believing it myself at some point, started thinking they were right, that I was a right down regular nutcase.

Except, of course, The Man came back. He looked differently, dressed differently, different face, different hair, different everything, looking younger than before - but it was him alright, and he knew me. Must have been about this time last year, I guess... We had some tea then. Now I know I've always been right, that the War was real and The Man was real, and I'm too old for them to lock me into a madhouse again. They'll just say I'm going a bit senile, so it's alright. I didn't imagine that second visit, either - he left me his number. I call him from time to time.

I think it is more creepy how many times we came close to nuclear armageddon due to accidents.

One I remember was we had a bomber always flying over Greenland with a sort of early warning post at a base there. The plane had a malfunction coming in for landing to fuel and was going down, crew bailed but the pilot did his best to direct it away from the post. The bombs it was carrying were later found to have major safety issues and could have (but didn't) detonate in the crash.

The plane had only been in contact with the post and the post hadn't notified the mainland about the incident. Had the plane crashed at the post and be the bombs gone off the US would have only known that suddenly a missile early warning post had disappeared...

Basically any aircraft that has disappeared anywhere near Bermuda triangle we've figured out was probably crashed by Methane. Boats too. Tons of methane suddenly seeping up in a shift would screw up localized buoyancy in a large enough event and the column of methane gas could choke an aircraft's engine.

It also could have been thousands of other things. A B-47 would have less lightning strike resistance than modern aircraft. Could have fried all their equipment and they went down silent.

Whhhhhat the fuck. I keep wondering why North Korea is getting away with the shit they do. More often than not, people are making jokes about Kim Jung Un and North Korea in general. I will agree that some of the things they do seem incredibly outdated and somewhat laughable such as the angry fax they recently sent to South Korea. However, there are serious human rights being violated, and I feel that a lot of people are making a joke about it all rather than realizing the severity of everything. Why is this not a bigger deal?

Edit: I should note that I am currently living in South Korea. I will say that about 98% of the Korean university students that I teach literally laugh when I mention North Korea or Kim Jung Un. He and North Korea are now seen as something to joke about. South Koreans are so close, yet so disconnected from the entire situation. North Koreans are their OWN PEOPLE! These are Koreans being tortured, starved, killed, and who knows what. Yes, I realize that we are all people, so it should not make a difference if they are Korean or not. Humans are suffering, and that is the main point. Regardless, for some reason as an American, I personally feel more connected to a story when I hear that Americans were involved. I don't know why that's the case, but it's true. I guess what I am getting at is that these people are their relatives, their great grandparents, perhaps. How can South Koreans not care more about their ancestors in the North?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]ChiaLetranger 51 points 4 years ago 
(As I'm sure you already know, being way closer to the situation than I am)... North Korea is a difficult situation. A lot of people there are brought into the Kim's enforced cult of personality, and we know very little about its internal structure. South Korea alone could invade, but this would anger not only North Korea, but also China - a force much too large for South Korea to fight alone. This means that South Korea needs support from a better equipped nation. America is a long-time ally of South Korea, and, as such, is the natural choice. Now, if America went in, then China would react even more aggressively, and Russia may even become involved. Now we have a three-way war by proxy between three of the world's biggest superpowers (and throw in their allies, for good measure). Why would China defend the North? They wouldn't. They would, however, defend the presence of a communist buffer zone between themselves and the US-backed South Korea. If the US and South Korea successfully push north, and unify all of Korea under the South's government, then China is living next door to America's buddy. China doesn't want that. Any sort of large-scale collapse of North Korea will lead to long-term instability and a vacuum with three or four major players trying desperately to get in first.

Why not just take out the Kims? Simply put, then we have an internal power struggle. The generals and higher-ups in the military will want to take it for themselves. The only viable solution is for the regime to be collapsed, and a puppet government installed by a major player, and now we're back at square one, which is everybody fighting everybody to see whose puppet gets in there. And even if somebody wins cleanly, in 20-some years we'll see another Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, when the government that's installed is no longer aligned with the interests of the superpower.

I think I remember a wikileaks leak detailing that China was getting sick of NK causing such a fuss that they would be okay with NK uniting with SK and SK's competent government taking over. Which I could see happening because then it would probably be easier to transport goods from China to Korea and vice versa. I could be wrong though, strategically the NK is a good buffer zone.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]ChiaLetranger 2 points 4 years ago 
I haven't seen that leak, but that would be very interesting. China is quite a large player in that region, and traditionally their leadership has favoured preserving the status quo so as to keep the region stable. It could be the case that, in playing the status quo off against the effect that North Korea has on the short-term stability of the region, China is beginning to see that dealing with NK is more important to them than preserving the status quo, which would lead to some VERY interesting shifts in the region. I mean, my brief rundown didn't even touch on Japan at all, and you can bet that they wouldn't be happy with China interfering at all.

Keep in mind as well how much time, money and resources it would take for SK to reincorporate the North.

South Korea would literally be bankrupt from the amount of money it would take to revitalize the north. To be perfectly honest South Korea has no interest in uniting the two, as the North would be such a drain on their economy and resources it's not even worth it at this point.

I am South Korean, and my family wants the reunification of the North and South. Sure, it's going to be expensive and difficult, but it's something that has to be done.

I also don't think the North hates the South. I've read the AMA's NK refugees and it seems the atmosphere there is, "Anything is better than here." Also, as a Korean, I'm probably more exposed to Korean-related news, so when I see the meeting days between the two, they're very emotional. We are a very prideful people.

As an American soldier serving in South Korea, I work alongside Korean soldiers (KATUSAs). They also regard North Korea as something of a throwback to older times, not a real threat at all. The Koreans I met don't seem to want to reconnect with NK at all. They seem to see the people of NK as too backwards to integrate into their society and don't want the social burden of millions of starving uneducated backward people ruining their country. Sounds harsh, but thats seems to be the 'common man' opinion with all the Korean soldiers I know. (also, despite being the closest military forces to the DMZ, they are supremely confident in crushing the NK military should war break out.)

KATUSA "suck honey" on government dime, in the Korean parlance. They're mostly over privileged brats who get it easy through their parents' connections.

NK could and would do massive damage before their military failed. Talking in the millions dead within minutes. This is the proverbial knife being held to the throat. There isn't any doubt the north would lose but the cost in human life would be insane.

perma-linksaveparent

[–]StopWhiteGirls 2 points 4 years ago 
In addition to the small number of nukes that NK has potentially going missing. The nation is shrouded in such secrecy that it's extremely difficult to pinpoint where the potential warheads are located. I've read about numerous scenarios going down, neither of which is all that beneficial:

-Generals or higher-ups could get access to the warheads when the Kim regime is largely wiped out, and who knows what a rogue official could do with even one warhead.

-Warheads could go missing, be smuggled out, sold to God knows who, etc.

-SK would have to deal with a massive insurgency of brainwashed North Koreans. Think Iraq/Afghanistan on speed, with a much larger stockpile of weapons.

-The South Korean economy would be decimated with the costs of re-educating, reintergrating and rebuilding an entire nation of millions of brainwashed, starving Koreans.

-Huge stockpiles of weapons (small arms particularly) could go "missing", and turn up in any 3rd world shithole civil war/revolution.

-NK citizens could commit "revolutionary suicide" (ala Jim Jones and his cult), either committing mass suicide, or taking out as many SK/US "dogs" as possible.

With that last scenario I thought about how they could easily lure South Korean troops into a major population zone within NK, with the intention of trapping them there, and setting off a nuke. Think about the casualty rate, the historical significance, and how North Korea would go down in history up there with Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Mao's China. It gives me chills just to think about it.

The UN tried doing something about NK 60 years ago, and it resulted in the current armistice agreement. Would you have us break that agreement?

That was most likely propaganda. Nations usually conduct smear campaigns before they are planning an invasion (check out the 'Kuwaiti incubator babies' story or the tale about Saddam's sons throwing people in acid vats).

Just before he was assassinated by proxy, I remember papers here in the UK insisting that Gaddafi was keeping corpses of his victims in bins outside his residence and using schools to draw fire of allied jet fighters.

I tried looking for more info elsewhere but kept running into the same problem as you. Then I looked on Reddit some more and found this thread. It seems to be the best source for information based in reality.

She was known to be bipolar before this incident happened (She had a blog where she talked about what it was like to be bipolar, will post link when I find it again), and that is thought to be the reason for all the strange behavior. What is really creepy is all of the similarities of the case to the 2002 Japanese horror film Dark Water). If you watch it the similarities are just eerie.

[–][deleted] 2 points 4 years ago 
You're right. When I first posted that I thought the bipolar story was a cover-up someone posted this blog as a citation of her having bipolar disorder so I stopped following the story (the blog had her picture on it, maybe it was someone who knew her). Much more creepy if it's not true that she was bipolar.

perma-linksaveparent

[–]Euron_Greyjoy 1 point 4 years ago* 
Tumblr does allow you to set up a queue for posts, to post at later dates in various intervals, or even schedule posts for specific dates in the future.

However, I'd prefer to think that her blog isn't running after her death. It's just a little unsettling.

Edit: Well at least it's not hers. The scheduling of posts so late would be super weird if it was, so case closed on that account.

Edit 2: Seems there's a chance it's her blog after all.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 2 points 4 years ago 
But why would she post something to be dated so far in the future? Are these really Elisa Lam's blogs? Even for a non-blogger I would think it's highly unusual for someone to post something so randomly far in the future.

edit: Apparently the blog found wasn't hers.

perma-linksaveparent

[–][deleted] 1 point 4 years ago 
I just did some digging through the blog and I think Euron_Greyjoy is right in the queue theory. The most recent post from December was reblogged from someone who posted it 11 months ago, before her death. It was probably queued so far into the future because it's a Christmas scene. As for the other random posts, the ones in February were likely queued because she was supposed to be traveling and figured she wouldn't be posting as much. From what I checked, the other couple of posts were also reblogged from people who posted them before her death. As to why those were queued, I don't have an explanation, but they are photos of people/things she had on her blog before... like that blonde model, also named Elisa. Maybe she just didn't want to spam a bunch of pictures at once?

perma-linksaveparent

[–][deleted] 1 point 4 years ago* 
Having just heard about this story from this thread and being very interested in finding more information about it that wasn't based in supernatural or conspiracies, I dug through the Tumblr and I'm almost positive that you're correct. The more recent posts were reblogged from people who posted them before her death, so it's likely they were in queue. Plus, the most recent post is a winter scene with a Christmas tree, which is why she queued so far in the future.

perma-linksaveparent

[–]Euron_Greyjoy 2 points 4 years ago 
That is quite reasonable. I know I've queued posts for holidays way ahead of time when I've encountered them. This is actually quite interesting!

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 2 points 4 years ago* 
Was it debunked that it wasn't hers or does it just have to do with the recent Tumblr updates? Just curious, I'm just hearing about this case through this thread and I found it very interesting. Looking around, her Tumblr is the only thing still being updated. If you look at this link and go to her other online profiles, none of them have been updated since her death, and her twitter is deleted. Another Reddit thread linked her Instagram, which hasn't been updated either and has a few comments mentioning her death (of course, they could have been posted by random people thinking it was her profile too).

Since the Tumblr is linked to other online accounts that share the same/similar usernames haven't been updated, it does seem to be hers. It is weird that it's been updated, though. Since there's only been a handful of posts since February, Euron_Greyjoy's explanation about queuing posts sounds the most plausible. And if you consider that she was supposed to be traveling and probably not updating her blog much, it makes sense that February would have the most amount of queued posts. A couple of the newer posts are of a model named Elisa too, who she had blogged pictures of previously. It wouldn't be too strange for her to have some more in queue. The only other thing I can think of is that Tumblr users can re-use usernames of deleted blogs, however, I don't think that's the case here as her entire archive would be gone as well.

... As I typed this up I noticed a couple other things. Her March 2011 archive has some photographs that seem to be the owner of the Tumblr. This one would probably be best for comparison as it shows her face, although if it was her, it's a couple years old, and is impossible to compare to the video at least. There is also a blog post about her being in LA. The more I look through the blog, the more I think you weren't wrong in saying that is was hers.

ETA - Okay, now I'm almost positive the most recent posts were queued. If you look at who she reblogged them from, they were posted before her death. For example, this video was reblogged from "lampfaced," who posted it on January 13, 2013. The most recent post with the lighbulb was reblogged from here, which says it was posted "11 mois" ago. Also, it makes sense that she would queue a snowy scene with a Christmas tree to post in December. I would try to go through more of the posts to see when they date back to but the blog is loading incredibly slow for me for some reason.

Bipolar disorder doesn't cause anything like this behavior. Happy --> sad --> happy --> sad OR happy --> mad --> happy --> mad, with periods of days to weeks between each end of the cycle.

That's it. That's all bipolar disorder does. Well, basically. If it can be attributed to happy/sad or happy/mad, then it's a behavior that can fit.

At first, Elisa enters the elevator and apparently presses all of its buttons. She then waits for something to happen but, for some reason, the elevator door doesn’t shut. She starts to look around, as if she is expecting (or hiding from) someone. At 1:57, her arms and hands start moving in a very strange matter (almost not human) as she appears to be talking to someone, something … or nothing at all. She then walks away. The elevator door then shuts and appears to start working again.

I don't know if you still needed that, considering how many posts there are now explaining/analyzing it but the video's really just unnerving.

I saw a pretty interesting theory about this that made a lot of sense. She dropped acid before this.

The person pointed out that her hand motions are similar to the hand motions of someone who is hallucinating on acid. Most likely she took a huge dose, and started hallucinating. She became paranoid and feared that someone was watching her. Look at how close she gets to the buttons. She has her face right in front of them, probably to stop them from melting off the side of the elevator. In her confusion, she pushed a ton of random buttons including the door open button.

She finally walked out, and finished her trip. In her trip she walked onto the roof. Acid causes heat hallucinations, and a desire for water. She probably was seeking out the only way to quench that through climbing into the water tank. Unfortunately, she was too stoned to swim, and died.

tl;dr Not creepy, she was on drugs.

EDIT: Oh.....no traces of drugs..... well fuck that idea, I guess. I am going with some sort of psychotic episode. Yeah, that's it.

It is clear to me that she is drunk, and someone is trying to coax her out of the elevator. She starts out by playfully hiding from them, and then tries to explain why she should leave (counting on her fingers at one point). The other person eventually convinces her to come back. My guess is that she and another person (people) were drunk/ high, were fooling around the water tanks and she fell in. When the other person/ people sobered up the next day they decided to keep the incident a secret.

Maybe she was just playing around? Once the doors wouldn't shut maybe she was just having fun or something. I'm by all respect a "normal" person, but sometimes it's just fun to do spontaneous things. Like dance around when no one's watching. Or in this case wave her arms around or play with the sensors on the elevator since she likely didn't know why it wasn't closing. I really didn't think the video was creepy at all since I took it as her just having some fun.

Hinterkaifeck

Hinterkaifeck, a small farmstead situated between the Bavarian towns of Ingolstadt and Schrobenhausen (approximately 70 km north of Munich), was the scene of one of the most puzzling crimes in German history. On the evening of March 31, 1922, the six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a mattock. The murder is still unsolved.

A few days prior to the crime, farmer Andreas Gruber told neighbours about discovering footprints in the snow leading from the edge of the forest to the farm, but none leading back. He also spoke about hearing footsteps in the attic and finding an unfamiliar newspaper on the farm. Furthermore, the house keys went missing several days before the murders, but none of this was reported to the police.

Six months earlier, the previous maid had left the farm, claiming that it was haunted; the new maid, Maria Baumgartner, arrived on the farm on 31 March, only a few hours before her death.

Exactly what happened on that Friday evening cannot be said for certain. It is believed that the older couple, as well as their daughter Viktoria and her daughter Cäzilia, were somehow all lured into the barn one by one, where they were killed. The perpetrator(s) then went into the house where they killed two-year-old Josef who was sleeping in his cot in his mother's bedroom, as well as the maid, Maria Baumgartner, in her bed-chamber.

The police first suspected the motive to be robbery, and interrogated several inhabitants from the surrounding villages, as well as travelling craftsmen and vagrants. The robbery theory was, however, abandoned when a large amount of money was found in the house. It is believed that the perpetrator(s) remained at the farm for several days – someone had fed the cattle, and eaten food in the kitchen: the neighbours had also seen smoke from the chimney during the weekend – and anyone looking for money would have found it.

Edit: Added a paragraph and fixed link.

I remember a story about a woman in Germany who went to buy a loaf of bread. She got a whole shopping cart full of money and went to get the bread. She forgot something and left the shopping cart on the streat to retrieve it. When she got back the shopping cart was gone, but the money was still there. That's how bad Germany's inflation was at the time.

"was looking to survive however he/she could."

It's possible if it were a frantic soldier crazed from combat or shell shock or PTSD, but most normal people wouldn't be able to just slay an entire family one by one with a melee weapon just to stay alive. Most (sane) people would resort to theft at first, possibly killing one and grabbing/running.

You need to read the entire story. Though you are probably in the ballpark, there are certain eerie aspects to the story. Like for one the former maid quitting because she thought the place was haunted. The other maid had only worked their for one day at the time she was killed. Other weird things were they found footprints leading to the house , but not away. Beyond that the killer lived in the house for several days afterwards.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]blaghart 1 point 4 years ago 
You just answered your own question:

Maid says it's haunted: perhaps dude was there already making weird noises, perhaps she was just a nutter

Maid dies on her first day: coincidence? Or the killer was afraid the maid had left to rat him out and decided to move then

Footprints going to the house but not away: in keeping with him coming from the forest and not leaving, which would be explained by him...

killer lived in the house for several days: tada. Which is logical if he was doing it to live. The house was a place to stay and a place that had food, and I doubt a man driven to murder a family in their beds was very stable mentally.

Hinterkaifeck bears a lot of similarity to the Villisca Axe Murders that occured ten years earlier in Iowa.

The Moore family consisted of parents Josiah (aged 43), Sarah (39), and their four children: Herman (11), Katherine (10), Boyd (7) and Paul (5). An affluent family, the Moores were well-known and well-liked in their community.[1] On June 9, 1912, Katherine Moore invited Ina (8) and Lena (12) Stillinger to spend the night at the Moore residence. That evening, the visiting girls and the Moore family attended the Presbyterian church where they participated in the Children's Day Program, which Sarah Moore had coordinated. After the program ended at 9:30 p.m., the Moores and the Stillinger sisters walked to the Moores' house, arriving between 9:45 and 10 p.m.

At 7 a.m. the next day, Mary Peckham, the Moores' neighbor, became concerned after she noticed that the Moore family had not come out to do their morning chores. Peckham knocked on the Moores' door. When nobody answered, she tried to open the door and discovered that it was locked. Peckham let the Moores' chickens out and then called Ross Moore, Josiah Moore's brother. Like Peckham, Moore received no response when he knocked on the door and shouted. He unlocked the front door with his copy of the house key. While Peckham stood on the porch, Moore went into the parlor and opened the guest bedroom door and found Ina and Lena Stillinger's bodies on the bed. Moore immediately told Peckham to call Hank Horton, Villisca's primary peace officer, who arrived shortly thereafter. Horton's search of the house revealed that the entire Moore family and the two Stillinger girls had been bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon, an ax belonging to Josiah, was found in the guest room where the Stillinger sisters were found.

Doctors concluded that the murders had taken place between midnight and 5 a.m.[2] The killer or killers began in the master bedroom, where Josiah and Sarah Moore were asleep. Josiah received more blows from the ax than any other victim; his face had been cut so much that his eyes were missing. The killer(s) then went into the children's rooms and bludgeoned Herman, Katherine, Boyd, and Paul in the head in the same manner as their parents. Afterward, the killer(s) moved downstairs to the guest bedroom and killed Ina and Lena.

Investigators believed that all of the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep at the time of the murders. Investigators also believed Lena attempted to fight back. She was found lying crosswise on the bed, and a defensive wound was discovered on her arm. Furthermore, Lena was found with her nightgown pushed up to her waist and no undergarments on, leading to speculation that the killer(s) sexually molested her or attempted to do so.

[–]DonQuiHottie 33 points 4 years ago* 
I came up with my own theory about this (disclaimer: entirely pulled out of my ass with no factual backup whatsoever) when I first read about this case on /r/UnresolvedMysteries (like crack for mystery fans, check it out).

The daughter Viktoria had been widowed in WWI, if I recall correctly, her husband described as KIA. In WWI, AKA a time when thousands of men were dying daily and it was impossible to keep accurate records. So lets imagine that hubby doesn't die. He is injured, captured or loses his mind, or any combination of the three. For whatever reason (take your pick: disability, poverty, external constraints), it takes him four years to get back home, and for whatever other reason (again, take your pick: he was presumed dead, he was insane, he had been maimed in some way) he hides his arrival from the family and takes refuge in the attic (hence the footsteps and attic noises). He may or may not discover the incestuous relationship between Viktoria and her father whilst he's there. Even if he wasn't already insane, that could drive most people over the edge. For this reason, or for some other reason only he can know (he feels they abandoned him/gave up on him too readily, he is insane) he kills everyone and buggers off into the night, never to be seen again (until tonight, when a flash of lightning illuminates his wrinkled, scar-ridden face outside your bedroom window...just playing).

It's not watertight but it seems more convincing to me than other explanations I've encountered.

Edit: Prompted by my own post, I've done more reading on the subject. Hubby's body was never found, but apparently consensus online is it's unlikely he's responsible. However whilst learning this I also learnt that Viktoria had slept around quite a bit in the village, and was apparently the first one to be killed. So how about this: village dude sneaks over for fun with Viktoria, they argue, he kills her, panics, lures rest of family in one by one and kills them too, then disappears.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]ShouldersofGiants100 9 points 4 years ago 
I doubt it... reads too much like a novel. KIA with no body was hardly uncommon and if there was any doubt, it would have been MIA... he was likely ripped apart by an artillery shell somewhere in Belgium, too much needs explaining with too many assumptions to explain it that way.

I've always thought that this particular tidbit of the case was of high interest: "The death of Karl Gabriel, Viktoria's husband who had been reported killed in the French trenches in 1914, was called into question. His body had never been found."

Think about it. He's reported killed but what if he survived? Deserted and spent eight years hiding out to avoid the authorities. Finally the war is over and the Weimar Republic begins to shudder along. The economy collapses. He's driven from town to town, plying whatever skills he might have or possibly just stealing to survive. Eventually he makes his way back to the lands north of Munich, lands he remembers. His feet carry him to his wife's father's farm, where he decides to check in on his family, who he assumes has long since given up on him. He discovers that his wife has been sleeping with her own father and has an incestuous child with him. Driven into an insane, disgusted rage, he manages to lure the family out to the barn and murders them one by one.

Dear God!

Wiki:

Subsequent investigation by forensic pathologists determined D4, being exposed to the highest pressure gradient, violently exploded due to the rapid and massive expansion of internal gases. All of his thoracic and abdominal organs, and even his thoracic spine, were ejected, as were all of his limbs. Simultaneously, his remains were expelled through the narrow trunk opening left by the jammed chamber door, less than 60 centimetres (24 in) in diameter. Fragments of his body were found scattered about the rig. One part was even found lying on the rig's derrick, 10 metres (30 ft) directly above the chambers.

As Psychology student, the Ice Pick Lobotomy is something that makes me feel so sick. I won't go into how he developed his method but it basically involved putting an ice pick under the patients eyelid and then moving it backwards and forward to severe the prefrontal cortex in the frontal lobes of the brain. He then set up a van which he would travel round giving these Lobotomy's to. He performed it on 1000's of suffers some including kids as young as 4.

This made me ill writing it

perma-linkembedsavegive gold

[–]bananabandanas 103 points 4 years ago 
I did some research for this for my graduation project, and it baffled me how Walter Freeman (developer of this method) is not more well-known. He didn't invent lobotomies as such - there was an older version referred to as leucotomy that were only to be utilized in extreme cases, according to the inventor (who received a nobel prize for this in 1947). These were carried out by drilling a hole in to the patient's forehead instead of going through the eyelids.

Freeman, however, started using an ice-pick he seemingly found in one of his drawers. He rarely washed up before surgery as he didn't "care about any of that germ crap".

I found it very fascinating how "showy" he was about this whole thing. as /u/LorzBinding mentioned, he had a van set up which he actually named the Lobotomobile. He often "performed" in front of an audience, and would sometimes perform 2 lobotomies at once: one with each hand. He claimed lobotomies to be a universal cure (not just to psychological but also physical ailments) and some reports state that he performed circa 3,500 lobotomies in his career.

Freeman, however, started using an ice-pick he seemingly found in one of his drawers. He rarely washed up before surgery as he didn't "care about any of that germ crap".

I found it very fascinating how "showy" he was about this whole thing. as /u/LorzBinding mentioned, he had a van set up which he actually named the Lobotomobile. He often "performed" in front of an audience, and would sometimes perform 2 lobotomies at once: one with each hand.

He was also wildly irresponsible as a "medical practitioner".

You most likely haven't heard of this because the medical profession likes to hide a lot of its past mistakes for example, antidepressant when they first came out were very unstable and made people very anxious and even caused other psychological problems (can't remember the name) but it made people want scratch off their own skin and get out of their body but a board overruled a decision to stop this drug because most were making profit off it. Things like this is in the past thank god and psychology is a much more trusting profession nowadays. People use to offer their children for this because they had hyperactive disorder, and it technically worked... But it caused other psychological disorders and even brain damage I believe. (Sorry if some info is incorrect, this was extra info for an essay we could of learnt a year ago and I didn't but still remember some of it from lectures)

Actually the same reason that nowadays they take kids to crystal healing, homeopathy, russian stem cell therapy or any such ineffective treatments. If your child is sick you will try anything that might cure him no matter how insane it sounds. Even if it has a one in a million chance what if your kid will be the one in a million. At that time mental disorders were considered much more serious than today and virtually no drugs were available for them. The parents took the only hope they were offered.

Fun fact: John F. Kennedy's sister Rosemary had a lobotomy when she was 23, because her family decided she was "mentally unstable." Here's how badly it got fucked up, from wikipedia:

"We went through the top of the head, I think she was awake. She had a mild tranquilizer. I made a surgical incision in the brain through the skull. It was near the front. It was on both sides. We just made a small incision, no more than an inch." The instrument Dr. Watts used looked like a butter knife. He swung it up and down to cut brain tissue. "We put an instrument inside," he said. As Dr. Watts cut, Dr. Freeman put questions to Rosemary. For example, he asked her to recite the Lord's Prayer or sing "God Bless America" or count backwards. ... "We made an estimate on how far to cut based on how she responded." ... When she began to become incoherent, they stopped.

After the lobotomy, it quickly became apparent that the procedure was not successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two year old child. She could not walk, speak intelligibly and was incontinent.

[–]lliinnddsseeyy 2 points 4 years ago 
If I understand correctly, in "successful" lobotomies that had been completed in the past, the person would basically just forget the problems that had been causing them to act out in the first place. Again, from wikipedia (sorry high school teachers):

Lobotomy patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition. They may also exhibit difficulty putting themselves in the position of others because of decreased cognition and detachment from society.

Basically the Kennedys were not the best parents, and instead of finding their daughter real help, they decided to take their chances with a horrible surgery that in the best case scenario, would have made her into a shell of a person who was easier to care for because she wouldn't know or care what the fuck was going on around her.

The worst part about that is her "acting up" that led to the lobotomy, was normal teenage and early 20's hormones. She grew up around brothers that were very successful and she was more than likely just a normal girl that couldn't keep up with the rest of her family's successes.

Some more facts to spice this up: the van was called the lobotomobile and he drove it around like a band going on your, performing lobotomies as he went, very often in living rooms and offices and not in medical facilities. He would often lobotomies individuals simply based on word of mouth that they were difficult or disorderly. He also carried on his lobotomies ing til well after if had fallen out of favor with the medical community. He was bound and determined that it would be the saving grace operation and so continued to lobotomize a couple dozen more people after the medical community turned against him. Also he won the Nobel peace prize in psychological medicine. His name was Moniz.

Though I will say that the youngest I've heard of him lobotomies ing someone was 11 or 12 so I think you may be over exaggerating with the 4

Why would we send any of that stuff? Some literature and a few major speeches are hardly a representation of humanity. And the point of the message wasn't to transmit technical knowledge.

How they interact. How similar and different it is to ours. Tweets would be much more capable of this then a few manufactured speeches, literature and a list of prime numbers and mathematical equations.

Reminds me of "The Bloop" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloop

Fox's hunch is that the sound nicknamed Bloop is the most likely to come from some sort of animal, because its signature is a rapid variation in frequency similar to that of sounds known to be made by marine beasts. There's one crucial difference, however: in 1997 Bloop was detected by sensors up to 4800 kilometres apart. That means it must be far louder than any whale noise, or any other animal noise for that matter. Is it even remotely possible that some creature bigger than any whale is lurking in the ocean depths? Or, perhaps more likely, something that is much more efficient at making sound?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

Loudest sound that may have been made by an animal.

While the audio profile of Bloop does resemble that of a living creature,[2] the source was a mystery both because it was different from known sounds and because it was several times louder than the loudest recorded animal, the blue whale.

Pretty sure there may be even louder sounds that were recorded, but I may be wrong.

Courville and Percy decided to test Tarrare's capacity for food. A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep;Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.

Hungry little fellow, huh?

Tarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the Army of the Rhine. Having swallowed the box successfully, Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with 30 pounds (14 kg) of raw bull's lungs and liver as a reward, which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals.

He ate a fucking wheelbarrow full of RAW bull's lungs and liver.

Prader-Willi syndrome, maybe? Watch some youtube videos about it, it's very fascinating.

Apparently, damage to certain parts of your brain will give you eating compulsions, so it's theorized that he may have had brain damage. But what really weirds me out is how he was only supposed to be average weight and then had all those things happen (smelled way worse, gave off a noticeable "vapor", etc.) after he ate.

Hitler has to exist, because he represents the least worst-timeline. No Hitler? German fascists still exist, but there's also a powerful Communist movement opposing them. German Civil War breaks out, USSR intervenes. The UK wants to intervene, but Communism had huge support among the French people and intellectuals at the time, and the UK refuses to go alone.

The result is an alternate history where all of continental Europe is under the Iron Curtain. Without the EEC, the trade with the continent, the UK also suffers economically and undergoes a communist revolution. Since the entire developed world has gone Communist, support for Communism builds in the US, and the result is a reactionary police-state. The entire world becomes totalitarian.

If Hitler dies at some point after becoming Fuhrer but before the war and the Holocaust, Nazism as an ideology is never discredited. It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades. Or, even after Nazi Germany's defeat, the Nazi party continues to exist as a strong political force in Germany because since Hitler dies before the fall of Nazism, Neo-Nazis can go around saying things about how the Nazis went astray, and how Hitler wouldn't have let the Holocaust happen, etc. As an ideology, Nazism needs to die discredited with Hitler.

I've corrected your mishaps TIME AND TIME AGAIN. Yes, your speech the last time we discussed these... these... experiments -about 'the Scientific Method' had a number of good points. But the thing is, the research about Hitler's death had already been repeated no less than a dozen times for each and every Death Instance that you went back and 'Tested'.

I will admit that a number of the other Death Instance Possibilities haven't been tested thoroughly, albeit because they a fair bit more obscure, as well not discounting the fact that walking into the offices of the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and shooting Hitler with a PT-67SX "Deathbringer™" Laserrifle would be a trifle obvious.

But you have been tampering with the most tested portions of the timeline, and I'm getting sick of having to correct it. If I have to shoot one more of your fucking observer-clones, I'm not sure exactly what I'll do. Look, if you want to tamper with the Current Timeline (TL 16መc-038ζՋ), please, for the love of Herbert, file a damn proper Timeline Experiment Form (Form 87ፈ-Жደ, and in Triplicate!) with the Shadow Proc. Department of Continuity.

That one has issues though. For one, it assumes Europe joins the allies before Russia invades. But without Hitler, there is no reason for that to actually happen. The united nations was formed as response to WW2, the EU was formed during the recovery period of WW2.

true that. but we can't tell for sure, because in C&C Red Alert I it isn't really shown how and why Hitler ceased to exist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert#Plot

so there is a lot possible espcially that a lot of german scientist stay in germany and the allies try to ally (by a lot of different possible means) with germany for the sake of nukes etc...

also hitler vanishes in 1924 which is quite early but not too late to have any influence.

As far as I can remember the first red alert had almost no fan service and had a plot that set it up as a prequel to the first C&C - retconned in later EA published games. Apparently EA thought axe crazy and fan service sells better than having a story.

Spoiler to the connection: The last video of the soviet campaign kills of Stalin with poisoned tea, his assistants Nadia and Kane reveal themselves as part of Nod and make you a figurehead ruler of the Soviet Union until "Nod tires of it". Basically one end of Red Alert 1 was a prequel to C&C1.

The goal of communism was never totalitarianism though. So who knows how it would have actually evolved if the whole world ran with it, and if separate movements implemented different versions of it.

The result is an alternate history where all of continental Europe is under the Iron Curtain.

This is just flat-out wrong. The Iron Curtain was put up because the Communist parties of Eastern Europe were imposed by and modeled after the USSR. Even when the Communists attempted to take over Germany in 1919, they attempted to implement a different form of Communism than the Marxist-Leninism of the USSR.

Furthermore, in the one country of Europe where Communism wasn't imposed but arose independently, in Yugoslavia, It was a much more liberal and market-friendly form of Communism and actually led to conflict between Tito and Stalin. Communists weren't some sort of hivemind that believed in totalitarianism for the sake of totalitarianism, they had tons of disagreements and many of them were killed by other Communists for it.

the UK also suffers economically and undergoes a communist revolution. Since the entire developed world has gone Communist, support for Communism builds in the US, and the result is a reactionary police-state. The entire world becomes totalitarian.

I don't know why you would assume this, Oswald Mosely and the Fascists were pretty powerful in Britain, as were Fascist movements in the rest of Europe. Although I think it is likely that the non-Communist regimes would become more reactionary (they were already pretty hostile to the movement, and had been since the Russian Revolution and Civil War), there's no way of knowing if they would go towards Communism or Fascism, or even remain Liberal democracies.

It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades.

Not really, the "Drive towards the East" had been part of German nationalist ideology since the 19th Century. Hitler wasn't the first who looked East for Lebensraum, just the most ambitious. There's no reason to believe the Nazi party would just drop one it's key platform points just because Hitler is dead. Whoever the new leader is, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Bormann, Hess or whoever, they would all want to expand Germany's borders East. Not to mention "Judeo-Bolshevism" was the big enemy, the party had been campaigning for years on the need to fight the Soviet regime, they weren't about to stop that anytime soon.

Neo-Nazis can go around saying things about how the Nazis went astray, and how Hitler wouldn't have let the Holocaust happen, etc.

Neo-Nazis already do say this. Except they say it about people like Rohm or the Strasser Brothers.

Well, im too late to this discussion but i like to contribute as well. Like you i have made this travel. You theroy is interessting but wrong at a crucial point. Facism wasnt a bigger thing in prenazi germany than it is now. Only Hitler/the NSDAP made is so popular. The facsim movement was very weak and small and only ganined influence because of the charismatic and brillant rethorical speaker Hitler was.

Here is what what happened if you would kill Hitler early enough:

Lets assume you have one chance to go back in time and you choose to bomb Hitler at the Hofbräuhaus at the 24. February 1920 where he would held his first important speech infront of 2000 people. You choose this point in time because Hitler hasnt done anything yet but you still want to blow up as many early nazis as possible. So you blow him up.

Bang.

Great. Is it? Well... This doesnt change much for europe. You killed a guy and some of his racist party friends. But the social unrests in germany proceed to result. Another person, wich equal rhetorical skills and charisma will apear. We will call him Argos, just for the fun of it. He gets elected the same way Hitler got elected but he will do this on a different political platform. But WW2 will still happen but the holocaust does not.

Argos is the contrary to Hitler. He is not insane.(Well he is, but in a much more dangerous and controlled way.) Hes not megalomaniac and he is a brillant strategist who will listen to his Generals. (Which are still the same Hitler got.) The German forces are now much stronger because of this. Argos could form a mighty german army where religons doesnt matter. He forms his army after napoleonic morals which makes his army superior to any army in the world, by moral, education and technical advantages. Still he kills all and everything that thinks otherwise to his party believes. There is only one Argos.

Argos expands into poland and fortifies his position instead of continuing to expand into the East. Same as Hitler, Argos takes in a Blitzkrieg fashion the Benelux, France and kills all the British Soldiers at Dunkirk, leaving Britain shattered. But then he stops. He plays the political game and stabilises the geopolitical situation for now. Now, not only are the german forces much much stronger, but most of the german intellectual elite has never left the country. In fact noone defected because Argos gives them all the Resources they need and scientists do what they do best under such conditions. They invent and build. Van Brown works in Pennemünde, without all the hassle the nazis gave him, on long distance rockets. Einstein, while not a fan of Argos and outspoken against the war, never had a reason to flee the country. He keeps working in Berlin.

The german counterpart of the "Manhatten Project", the German nuclear energy project, short the Uranium Club, is Argos pet project. The Uranium Club is therefore much faster in their research, because all the physicists, engineers, and mathematicians who were driven out of Germany by Hitler as early as 1933 are still there and working as hard as they can for Argos. Also the USA doesnt have much time to look closely at Europe because they are focused on the Japanese Movement and the developments in the Pacific Area. Germany develops the atom bomb.

A german nuke carried by the japanese fleet hits Peral Harbor in a preemptive strike. Argos forces the surrender of all major nations on the continent after decimating every other capitol city with nuclear weapons. Europe becomes a single nation headed by a dictator. Building an entire eastern Powerbloc and threatening the rest of the world. The US is forced to expand into canada, mexico and south america to fortify all possible points of entry for nuclear weapon drops. Both continents enter into a war that nobody is sure who will win.

or we could have not given the scapegoat germans, who were sort of forced into a war they had no chance of winning, to pay war reparations, and instead done what we did after WW2 and helped rebuild them. hitler wouldn't be so bitter for a start, not to mention would not have been even close to as popular. Germany would have no longer been a powder keg, and all of Europe would be allies with the US and the red threat would have been quickly shut down.

It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades.

I suppose possible, but unlikely. Fascism was in many ways a defense mechanism against the spread of Communism. I can't imagine they would have co-existed peacefully much longer than they already had.

Also, what would happen if you killed Hitler (and possibly other Nazi leaders such as Goebbels) at some point early in the war? Still late enough that the Holocaust was underway and had even more witnesses than the alpha timeline (i.e. Nazism is discredited), but severely reducing the scope of the slaughter. Seems like something to try.

[–]apc4455 -6 points 4 years ago* 
No, this is not true. Fascism and national socialism are as much collectivist ideologies as international socialism. The two only differ that one puts emphasis on a specific race while the other is race independent. At the end of the day they are two sides of the same coin.

Also, if you look into the history of communism you'll realize that despite all the ideologies and promises on paper it always turns into national socialism. Just look at all communist countries and you'll realize that at one point nationalism became a very important factor.

If Hitler would have won WWII then Germany would have pretty much looked 100% the same as any communist country in the 2nd half of the 20th century, with the abolishing of private property, central planing of the economy and single party dictatorship.

If you really think about it there isn't much difference between national socialism and international socialism. Hitler and Stalin were just like two mob bosses fighting for territory and not polar opposites in ideology.

So what is your opinion on basically everyone, including Hitler, agreeing that the foundation of Nazism is anti-socialism? That Nazism is the reaction against the Marxists who want to remove the existence of private property and that one of the core tenets of Nazism is the defense of private property?

Why did Hitler gain the support of conservative politicians who even made him part of the government, why didn't the communists gain the support of conservative politicians? Why did Hitler gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany, why didn't the communists gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany?

These facts don't really fit in your narrative, that's why I'm asking these questions.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]apc4455 -1 points 4 years ago* 
So what is your opinion on basically everyone, including Hitler, agreeing that the foundation of Nazism is anti-socialism?

1.) Hitler was not against international socialism because of the economic theory of international socialism. Hitler was against international socialism because of its internationalist nature and that it claimed all races are equal (pretty much the only thing communism got right). Hitler believed that Germans (arians) are racially superior to other "races". This was the primary reason Hitler was against communism. He had no problem with the economic theory of communism.

2.) Why would someone who bases his party's foundation on anti-socialism call his party "National Socialist German Workers' Party" - don't you find this just a little bit weird?

That Nazism is the reaction against the Marxists who want to remove the existence of private property and that one of the core tenets of Nazism is the defense of private property?

Indeed, fascism was a reaction to Marxism, that's perfectly clear. But not because of capitalism vs. communism, as in the economic theory, but because of the fact that as said above, communism was an internationalist movement while fascists claimed that the particular ethnic group they belonged to was superior to others. It was the race thing that set them apart and not the economic thing.

The thing about private property: Private property only exists if no outside force can confiscate it for whatever reason. Nazism, like communism, is a collectivist ideology that states that the individual can be sacrificed for the good of the group. i.e. if confiscating your property by force and at your expense is deemed to be beneficial for a larger group of people then it's perfectly justified. Nazis had no problem with this, they just didn't went as far as the communists but they came pretty close.

Just ask the jews (and any other persons/groups that the ruling party didn't like for whatever arbitrary reasons) how their private property was defended. This is also how it began in communism: First only the property of the state's "enemies" was confiscated, eventually it happened to everyone.

Why did Hitler gain the support of conservative politicians who even made him part of the government, why didn't the communists gain the support of conservative politicians?

Because the conservative politicians, like Hitler, were nationalists and believed in the supremacy of Germany and wanted to revenge Germany's defeat in the previous war. Communists, on the other hand, were internationalists and didn't care if Germany as a country lost or won, as they didn't really care about any other arbitrarily drawn lines on the map either.

Why did Hitler gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany, why didn't the communists gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany?

Because under Nazism those capitalists were de facto made part of the government. Their factories basically supplied all the goods and services needed for the German war machine. Those companies completely depended on the government and had the government as their main client.

However, they weren't really private companies de facto, as it wasn't like they could do whatever they want. They still had to execute whatever the party told them to execute and produce whatever the party told them to produce. They were basically an unofficial branch of the government.

In other words, they were de jure privately owned companies however de facto they were state controlled and centrally commanded businesses. From here it just takes one step towards communism. The economy of Nazi Germany was as far as it could get from free market capitalism.

You can like it or not, fascism and Nazism aren't the polar opposites to communism. They are obviously not the same however they aren't as far away from each other as one might think.

2.) Why would someone who bases his party's foundation on anti-socialism call his party "National Socialist German Workers' Party" - don't you find this just a little bit weird?

Good question. Why would anyone who bases his party on anti-socialism call his party the "National Socialist Germany Workers' Party"? According to Hitler:

"Why," I asked Hitler, "do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?"

"Socialism," he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, pugnaciously, "is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.

"Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic."

From an interview Hitler did.

So Hitler thought that communists, Marxists, all kinds of socialists who were against the institution of private property were not real socialists. They were people who stole the word socialist. Note that at the time and today, the definition of socialism was basically 'a revolutionary against the capitalist institution of private property'. Wanting to change the meaning of socialism from 'against private property' to 'being nationalist and for private property' is a pretty big change, don't you agree?

At the time in Germany, socialism was immensely popular. The number one political party was the conservative party. The number two was often the communist party. Calling yourself socialist was a PR move, just like using the color red and appropriating other words used by socialists and communists. The clearest case of this was the Spanish fascist party the Falange, where they simply said: "the anarchist flag was red and black, we wanted ours to be similar."

So again to be clear, 'stealing' symbols used by leftists was one of the strategies fascists used. Even if the ideologies sharply contrast.

Your knowledge of German's history is lacking. Why did the predecessor of the Germany Nazi party fought against German communists in the Rhineland to defend private property during the German revolution?

Your justification for saying that communism and fascism are the same is that both the fascist ideology and Soviet Communism had the state take action. So is the US fascist as well? The US state confiscates property all the time. In times of war the US confiscates money belonging to parties it deems to be the enemy. It also tells weapon manufacturers that they are not allowed to sell their property to certain groups. Is this evidence of the US being anti-capitalist? Your definition of socialism basically being 'state intervention' is misplaced. Every capitalist society relies on state intervention. It is weird to say a society is not capitalist because it has state intervention.

Even the rise of capitalism as an economical system was paired with an extreme amount of state violence under direction of the capitalists as a class. Is the rise of capitalism socialist? Were the capitalists who directed this violence both owners of capital and socialist? If that is your definition of socialism, then you've defined socialism as something that runs completely contrary to any meaningful definition, the history of socialism, and the definition of socialism used by socialists.

Your answer to my question about why Hitler was supported by conservatives is pretty weak. Simply by being a nationalist you are given an important position in the government? Why didn't all of the other nationalists get invited to join the government?

Fascists generally had the support of the army, right-wing paramilitary groups, conservative politicians, religious institutions, monarchists, and the richest capitalists. They were reactionary, anti-leftist, specifically anti-communist, anti-intellectual, racist, pro-private property, and nationalist. Socialists generally had the support of unions, workers, racial minorities, and some intellectuals. They were revolutionary, anti-capitalist, anti-conservative, anti-racist, and anti-nationalist.

Somehow you seem to think that these are the same. I think it comes down to you not liking both, so that's why they are the same. The rest is justifying for yourself why you believe that to be the case, ignoring that they are polar opposites.

If Hitler was killed, there still where many other fascist groups, at least early on, before he really gained power. If he was killed early on in the war, before relations with Russia turned sour, fascist Germany may have had a victory over a great deal of western Europe. Fascism becomes a viable political option, and perhaps popular with a number of European countries.

Fascism was very popular among intellectuals in the interwar period. With major publications on fascism. In France, Denmark, etc... there was a growing interest in it as a political theory. World War Two doesn't happen, the depression lasts longer, fascism starts looking pretty good to lots of people.

I doubt you have a working time machine, and you can't kill someone multiple times in this situation unless you stopped yourself from killing him the first time. That would create a paradox.

Also, I don't know of any video games where they explain the end result of you killing Hitler at a different point in time than in reality when he shot himself.

Lastly, alternate history timelines are too unpredictable and unlikely. Don't even think about falling back on those for an argument.

To everyone treating this like an unassociated event, Megan Fox was not cast in Transformers 3 after EP Stephen Spielberg took issue with her comparing Michael Bay to Hitler.

OP is implying that if there's no Hitler, there's no Holocaust, and Spielberg doesn't get upset about a comment that doesn't get made... thus, Douche Witwicky doesn't wind up leaving his supermodel girlfriend of which the relationship is plausible due to their shared world-saving experience and winding up with his 2nd supermodel girlfriend that makes no sense at all (and who subsequently is involved in key parts of the movie where she effectively single handedly saves the moment, thus being directly responsible for saving EARTH and the entire human race)

TL;DR - Transformers 3 makes no fucking sense. Hitler should have just targeted the Bay and LaBeouf families.

edit: nevermind here it is "He's like Napoleon and he wants to create this insane, infamous mad-man reputation," Fox told the magazine. "He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is. So he's a nightmare to work for but when you get him away from set, and he's not in director mode, I kind of really enjoy his personality because he's so awkward, so hopelessly awkward. He has no social skills at all. And it's endearing to watch him."

The German soldier saw him lower his rifle and nodded his thanks before wandering off. That soldier is purported to have been Adolf Hitler."

All great points. He also had pretty stupid ideas when it came to funding research projects - he was obsessed with certain projects like the V2 (resources and labour could better be used elsewhere), he threatened to defund the Me-262 unless it was a bomber (he eventually caved to let it be an interceptor, but too little too late), infighting and an order by him led to the StG-44 being developed secretly, his focus on too many fronts and so many more things.

He was the opposite of Stalin. As the war went on Stalin kept giving more and more power to other people, but Hitler kept firing generals and consolidating power.

Debt isn't really a bad thing if the money was spent to spur growth. Expamples: FDR, Reagan, any business that started out by taking out a business loan.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Ameisen 21 points 4 years ago* 
No, and I don't disagree with that

The problem here is that you don't understand the level of debt that we're discussing. The German economy itself wasn't producing consumer goods, generally, and especially not for export. Most of its industrial capabilities in the 30's were going directly towards rearmament.

First off, unemployment numbers were fudged. The Nazis removed women from unemployment numbers (they were counted under the Weimar Republic). They also removed Jews in 1935 (as they lost citizenship) and if you were unemployed, you either accepted government-paid labor (the vast majority of projects were not useful public works, unlike in the US) or you were sent to a Concentration Camp. They also enacted conscription as part of rearmament, which also reduced the number. So, yes, he reduced unemployment. Not in an economically healthy manner. Germany's military expenditures until 1938 (I don't have data thereafter) were 10% of their GDP, but that's only counting IMMEDIATE military expenditures, not all the other stuff they were doing that had military applications.

Debt-wise, Germany had a debt of 40 billion Reichsmarks in 1939, and their balance of trade was RM (100 million). Their annual income was RM 15 billion, and their deficit was over RM 15 billion (> 30 billion expenditure). IIRC, their GDP in 1939 was roughly RM 180 billion (or 129, having trouble finding sources).

This differs from Roosevelt in that the New Deal was explicitly building infrastructure -- the US was trading debt for growth. Germany was trading debt for weapons. Germany was reliant on taking other countries' hard currency to fuel their growth - the first thing that happened after marching into Bohemia was all currency reserves were taken. Same with Poland, same with France, Netherlands, Belgium, etc. In 1939, actually, the German economy was very close to collapse because of the financial strain of rearmament, hence the decision to invade Poland.

He didn't drag them out of depression by murdering a group of people...

The hatred of certain untermensch was part of a project to establish a continuity to the German nation, and an unchallenged assumption that they deserved their position as a superior race of Europeans. If anything the subordination of none ayrians was just a way to legitimise and naturalise the Nazi belief of their genetic superiority. However, that's by no means the only thing he did while in power, and initially didn't necessarily imply genocide needed to occur. Admittedly it did result in a disgustingly racist society that feared anyone who didn't conform to ayrian ideals, but was it so different to the hatred and fear of the red under the bed under McCarthy in the early years?

Hitler did a hell of a lot of good stuff for Germany. In terms of judging him through a Machiavellian lense he was really quite successful.

Please don't get me wrong, I am in no way condoning Hitler's actions, but to say he achieved everything he did 'through murdering a whole group of people' is spurious and belittles some of the very real achievements he had with regards to his economic and nation building policies. That said, it doesn't stop him being (in the words of eddy Izard) a 'mass murdering fuckhead'.

Not letting Rommel retreat in North Africa, invading Russia without winter clothes for the wermacht, directing the battle of Britain against London instead of the RAF...

The list goes on and on.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Ameisen 11 points 4 years ago* 
Not letting Rommel retreat in North Africa

Wouldn't have made a big difference to the war effort.

invading Russia without winter clothes for the wermacht

Winter gear would have had to have been manufactured. The timing of Barbarossa was timed to be optimal for the invasion (and it actually was), so any delays would doom it beforehand, since the USSR was only getting stronger. One concern was that since they'd have to supply the winter gear after the invasion had begun, it would demoralize the men who were now aware that their leadership did not expect the war to be over by Christmas.

directing the battle of Britain against London instead of the RAF

Many of the RAF bases were outside of the range of the Luftwaffe.

EDIT: If you're going to downvote, bother to respond with which that you disagree. Perhaps you think that the Desert Fox' campaign actually has significant besides being an entertaining sideshow to both the British and Hitler? Perhaps you think that the Luftwaffe almost defeated the RAF? (it didn't). Perhaps you think that Germany just had millions of units of winter gear sitting around (it didn't)? Choices in war aren't always as simple as 'we need this and this and let's add this!' -- if that were the case, Germany clearly should have entered the war equipped with PzkwIIIs, aircraft carriers, and let's just throw Me262s on there for good measure. Wartime manufacturing capabilities are delegated out because they have to be, regardless of country. Nobody has infinite manufacturing capacity nor resources (well, other than the US relative to anyone else in WW2 - the American industrial potential was staggering compared to all their opponents and even potential opponents (the USSR) combined), Germany already had manpower issues by 1941, and they frankly didn't have the manufacturing capacity to produce winter gear en masse at the time, and not without delaying the invasion until next summer at the very least, which would have doomed the operation to complete failure. The USSR, after 1941, was rearming faster than Germany was producing new military equipment. Let that sink in. The USSR is stronger relative to Germany in 1942 than they were in 1941. Strategically, Germany didn't have a choice in the matter (and isn't perfect hindsight grand?) as to when to invade, if they were going to invade (relations had strained between Germany and the USSR since late 1940, and war was likely inevitable by 1941).

I certainly didn't down vote you, but the 3rd point is indisputable: The RAF was on its last legs when Hitler ordered London destroyed instead.

(It was well-understood that an amphibious invasion could not succeed against a country with a functioning air force).

It is certainly disputable; I am disputing it. The RAF had airbases that were well outside of the range of the Luftwaffe; while the Luftwaffe could certainly have achieved air superiority in southern England, the RAF would simply use airbases further north, which still had enough range to reach the channel. At that point, it becomes a battle of attrition; a battle Britain is likely to win.

There was no way at all that Sealion would have succeeded. Period.

The Germans had no way to defeat the Royal Navy. Their naval bombing record was extremely poor, and the Royal Navy and the remnants of the RAF would prevent any landing attempt.
The Germans lack any proper equipment to mount an invasion with. Their plan was to use river barges... which if they didn't simply sink in the Channel would be extremely vulnerable.
The Germans lack the logistical capability to supply/reinforce troops landing in England. Even if they manage to land, they will be surrounded and eliminated.
The Soviet Union isn't interested in total German victory. Stalin wanted the Germans and the Allies to exhaust one another; a victorious Germany is a huge existential threat to the Soviet Union.
An invasion of England is something that is likely to trigger American entry into the war before Pearl Harbor. Isolationism only goes so far, and that is likely to worry people enough to intervene.

He wasn't actually that terrible a military leader, he was just overzealous. His generals continuously told him not to attack, to wait, and yet he went on ahead with it. Over the course of a month, they conquered Poland. Over the course of another month about a year down the line, they conquered France. If this isn't confirmation that your thoughts about your overcautious generals are correct, then I don't know what is.

In fact, had Operation Barbarossa been initiated when it was supposed to be, (and focused more on Moscow and less on other targets), the Germans may well have defeated the Soviets. Barbarossa was delayed because the Italians fucked up the Greek campaign (like every campaign they were involved in), and the Germans had to go fix it.

Stephen Fry wrote a book called "Making History" in which a situation is described where someone even worse comes into power. It wasn't just that Hitler was a horrible person it's that the political climate of Germany at the time meant someone like that could be successful.

Hitler was also originally interested in attending the Vienna School of Art. After being rejected, he lived in the sewers and slums of Vienna, where he became part of a political party known as the National Socialism Party. An attempted coup, jail time, and a book later, look what happened.

All because he was denied entry to the Vienna School of Art

" Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosom's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb. "

One of the very best performances in movie history, performed in one take, after filming had to shut down due to Shaw being too drunk to do the scene he did it the next day.

I was at a theater with the SO when the house lights came up and there was a general alert to evacuate. As the crowd headed to the lobby I grabbed her arm and took her out a completely different exit, away from the main parking lot. Outside she looked at me with a WTF look. I told her if there is an emergency scenario to blindly obey me, as I've already considered the options.

The emergency was just a failed sensor in the HVAC, I found out the next day.

It is also false. They were equipped with "alarm bars" which would sound when opened, but they were not locked.

The problem was that very few people knew about these alternative exit doors.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]sixbanger 1 point 4 years ago 
I assume the band members, staff and such went out these back/alternate doors? and also, this is why exit doors (at least around here) must have some sort of lighting above/near them so you (hopefully) can see them in an emergency.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Bunchofbees 1 point 4 years ago 
It is, isn't it? Another thing I've read about a different fire: doors opened inwards. That sort of thing, coupled with pressing bodies, means people get themselves stuck. Terrifying.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]lampimampi 3 points 4 years ago 
They were not. One was being guarded by a bouncer who was not letting anyone ( except the band and affiliates) through, and the rest were located at the end of turns in the hallway in the adjoining room that most people didn't know were there because they couldn't see them. Most people tend to instinctively run toward the exit they entered through.

I was actually at the Station a few months before this fire. It was a Kiss tribute band and the lead singer had a candelabra and did a little fire breathing a la Gene Simmons. Anyway, I remember thinking very clearly what I would do if the place caught fire and what my backup plans would have been. There weren't half as many people that night as during this event, and a fire still would have been pretty devastating.

Normally, I'd supply a link to a claim like this, but I really don't want to accidentally run through a single second of that video again to make sure it's the one I'm talking about. All I know is that it's certainly on Reddit somewhere and probably elsewhere, too.

Edit: Not sure why this is being downvoted, though I'll assume it's because I refused to find the right video and post it for others' convenience. Now, I watch a lot of fucked up stuff. For example, /r/WTF is actually one of my favorite subreddits where no link stays blue. But that video? No. I don't mind if others link it because it helps spread the awareness of the issues that arose in this incident, arguably in an effective manner if one also educates his/herself on the aspects of the trial and its ensuing consequences (good and bad) for safety policies.

Instead, here's a link of the foundation for the fire victims you can donate to: http://www.stationfirememorialfoundation.org/

The video shows people trying to help which is more than you can ask for in that situation. Its easy for me, as someone watching the video from the safety of my home, to say 'I would have done this or that'. Though, I cant ever picture myself videotaping an incident in which 100 people are dying right in front of me and I cant give a helping hand to a single one of them. Instead I envision myself outside that door, grabbing people by whatever clothing or limb that i could get a hold of and dragging them out as forcefully as possible. I think its pretty appalling that some of the comments responding to me, would rather he videotaped the incident than save a life.

Not really. Language progresses like this frequently. A word can mean one thing and then progress into a slightly different meaning.

I realize that words do change meaning over time, and it's my opinion that at the very beginning of that transition you will find someone using the word incorrectly who doesn't know any better.

[–]PerfectLogic 1 point 4 years ago 
Because, by then, he had engaged Luke in combat and felt the dark side possibilities in him with his outbursts of anger. He had probably felt out the other (light) side of the Force in him as well. And, since Luke had been trained how to actually manipulate the Force by Yoda in Empire Strikes Back, he was not just Force-sensitive at this time. He was actively tapping into and using the Force, changing it to adapt to his needs. It's the equivalent of playing Marco Polo in a pool. If you just stay silent there on a rubber float and don't move, the person with their eyes closed might not know you're there. But if you are splashing around creating all sorts of disturbances, (in the Force), then they most certainly will be able to not only sense you but also what direction you may approach from as well. With Luke being so new in the ways of the Jedi, he was probably not able to hide himself as well as more disciplined Jedi. The real question is how does a brand new Jedi take down the two top Sith lords?

[–]this_isnt_happening 1 point 4 years ago 
I think it's interesting they say the mind of a two year old but that she was nonverbal. My son's two and nonverbal, but that's because he's autistic. Two year olds are capable of a surprising amount of complexity. I wonder how accurate or generous that description of her is. It was interesting reading about the activities they would do with her and using my son to understand better how that probably went. Then my daughter is about the age she was mentally before surgery, so looking at them both and that juxtaposition has been very interesting for me. I would say as far as the "lightbulb" goes, the difference isn't as vast as one might think. Personality develops long before academic ability. The trouble would be in the sudden inability to understand the world around you. With that in mind, making her world objectively smaller was a kindness, really. Although in all this I've conveniently forgotten the fact that personality is largely seated in the frontal lobe- the same place her surgeons whipped up some mushroom soup.

You know what, though? I'm sick and I think the cough syrup is making me loopy. I'm leaving this comment, but I'll probably be embarrassed about it later. C'est la vie.

From the article, "the maturing Kennedy became increasingly assertive and rebellious. She was also reportedly subject to violent mood swings. Some observers have since attributed this behavior to her difficulties in keeping up with siblings who were expected to perform to high standards..."

Well I see that the comment I responded to was deleted and in that comment, "getting in the way" referred to the Kennedy's political aspirations. So in that sense, her behavior was probably seen by the Kennedy's as "getting in the way". I wasn't trying to make what they did sound reasonable, it's disgusting.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]akpak 1 point 4 years ago 
I agree with you that it was disgusting, at least by our standards of mental healthcare today. It does seem that the damage done wasn't intended to be so bad. Lobotomies were fairly common then, and some of them did "work out."

I don't agree that it was done maliciously, or that it was done because she "knew too much" as some people in this thread are implying.

It was a pretty poor decision to make, but on some level they probably did think it would help her.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

I'm pretty sure Dad is the asshole there. In that era, women weren't known for having a lot of autonomy. If Joe said "no one goes to see her," then no one does.

Neither if you ask me, I'm more weirded out that it was publicly. That means that somebody in the Senate had thought of giraffe-rape as a public form of punishment, convinced the other senators to pass it, and that people profited from this public raping.

Do not be too surprised, the Chilean Pinnochet regime trained dogs to rape women. And the men who did it trained in the USA, and this was done with the tacit support of the CIA.

Problems with your statement of Locusta being a spree killer:

Spree killer Serial killer

I link these with no intent to insult you, but so that we may begin our trains of thought on the same page.

Locusta certainly killed more than three people, and there was a 'Cooling off period' in her cycle. This cooling off period is mostly due to her imprisonment, but it is still present.

[–]ChainerSummons 1 point 4 years ago 
You're assuming that it is the serial killer which defines the term, which is backwards reasoning. The term is made for the serial killer's aspects, a criteria which they either meet or do not. One of the criteria is the cooling off period, which makes them distinct from repeat kills, habitual killers, ritualistic killers, and spree killers.

We can safely say that she was a serial killer due to her matching the following criteria:

Minimum of 3 victims 'Cooling off' period

These are the main identifiers of a serial killer. Granted, after her release, she worked for the state as a poisoner, but before that time she still had her three minimal victims. Her motives are not in question past that point, as she worked for the state in secret. Her actions are the qualifiers, not the motive or the driving force behind them.

To address your statement of

If someone were to hold a gun to another person's head and force them to perform this or that act, we can't examine those acts the same way that we would if they'd done them of their own volition.

We are not attempting to hold trial, we are classifying actions. We are not casting any form of judgment, simply applying an adjective.

That's all well and fine, but as neither of us are FBI agents, nor (I assume?) do we have access to such agents, it would be best to refer to definitions of the terms used as they are. Perhaps the criteria for the FBI does not line up 100% with the English language definition at present- and I accept that- but it is all we have at this point in time.

We didn't survive because we invented forks or some shit, we survived because we were the only ones that had the necessary combination of ingenuity and cooperation to survive. Those two traits also eventually led to forks. And space shuttles.

However, like any theory about shit that happened tens of thousands of years ago, there is some debate about it. None of the debate says that no bottlenecking occurred, as far as I'm aware, it just centers around exactly how much of our current traits we can credit to that bottleneck.

Dominant means we can kill every single thing on this planet if we want to. We just decide not to because that would be stupid. That's what dominant means.

If there was another species that could kill us at their 100% vs our 100%, meaning a lion at full health versus a man with a nuclear bomb, then we wouldn't be dominant.

The fact that we organise ourselves made us dominant, although other animals organize themselves. The only reason we are dominant is because we can build very complicated utensils that animals can't.

Exactly. I had a friend do it one time just for the hell of it, not full blown, just like water on the face with a cloth covering. I lasted like 3 seconds because that diving reflex kicked in and it was fuuuuucked up. Give it a try. It's not like it's going to scar you for life, it's just surprising how effective it is. Get a t-shirt or something, put it over your face, and have someone pour a bucket of water over it slowly. Try to hold your breath :)

It's an overreaction of the diving reflex, stress seems to make it more common. Like most people don't get it just from swimming in cold water, but are way more likely to get it if suddenly thrown overboard into it.

There is more than one kind of dry drowning. You are talking about laryngospasm, which can occur with little or no water actually entering the lungs. People who suffer from GERD tend to get frequent, generally non-fatal, attacks of laryngospasm.

Other causes of dry drowing include exposure to gases such as methane, muscular paralysis and hyponatraemia. Carbon monoxide poisoning could also be considered 'dry drowning'.

Actually evidence that the assassination was at least organized by British operatives. Rasputin was gaining power and was an outspoken advocate for peace and lover of Germany. At best England would lose an ally in WWI, at worst he would lead Russia onto the side of Germany. The entire supernatural story/changing events are because Rasputin was tortured/interrogated and the men responsible were covering it up to make themselves look better.

According to an unpublished autopsy report and its later reviews (mentioned in the Wikipedia page)...

It could not be determined with certainty that he drowned, as the water found in his lungs is a common non-specific autopsy finding.

So it seems there was some water in his lungs, but not enough so as to be associated with death by drowning.

There is no need to be snarky. Historians do tend to read multiple sources, especially when there is conflicting evidence. The brazen bull, for example, was not commonly used and is now subject to myth and sensationalism. I'm not even sure there is an authentic surviving brazen bull from the related era to make judgement on the design.

I've seen a few psychotic breaks. Her reactions look like one. And a lot of people say that she was acting fine shortly before, but I've also read articles that said that she was acting weird and felt that someone was following her. So, paranoia, impending psychotic episode (which can come out of nowhere), combined with an electrical glitch in the elevator...full blown psychotic episode.

Not sure how she ended up in the water tank, tho...

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 26 points 4 years ago* 
I honestly think the most likely answer is that she found a way to climb in by herself, thinking that she was protecting herself. I know that it keeps being said that it would have been very hard/impossible for her to do that, but there's a lot of liability on the university and the maker of the tank to insist that people can't just randomly climb into them.

EDIT: When my son is psychotic, he does extremely dangerous things, thinking that he is keeping himself safe from either people that no one else can see or numbers or demons or whatever. I've found him in the basement, he used to wander the neighborhood until we installed double deadbolts, I've had to stop him from bolting into traffic. The point being that he has more fear of these things that don't exist than he does of the real dangers of drowning, traffic, getting lost, whatever. Most people are like that when they are psychotic. Not all, but most.

The land is supposedly cursed due to certain actions by the family who owned it originally. Other than that, there's been murders around the park, and not to mention the Hollywood sign suicides which is pretty close.

Personally I've seen the ghost of the actress who jumped off the sign. Group of friends and I thought it be a wonderful idea to go up to the sign at 2am (sober). I, being a fan of everything paranormal, decided to venture ahead. Lo and behold, saw a white shade moving slowly to me. I ended up nope-ing out of there, along with my friends.

Other experiences ranges from cold spots (78 degrees at night during the summer and out of nowhere 54?), shadows moving around, and suddenly a dreadful feeling(usually around the abandon zoo).

I know I didn't give much detail, but if it matters, my family dabbled in Santeria since the 70's and their parents long before that. I'm a rational person, but the shit I've seen in my childhood and now adult life makes it easier for myself to "see" what others cannot. Whether it's a gift or curse, I managed to survive a few fatal instances.

I read a post saying that other pictures of her showed her wearing glasses, but she doesn't have them on in the video. With her being hard of sight without them, she accidentally hits the "hold door" button on the elevator, which stops it from opening. (Watch the video again, just after she hits all of the buttons you can see the door close around 2 inches then stop)
The weird hand movements were supposedly her being confused by the elevator not working, and waving her hands around to see if there was some sort of motion sensor she needed to set off for it to work. You can see that she walks out behaving normally, stands at the side of the elevator, then at around 1:57 puts her arm straight with the wrist bent, waving her arm up and down in the doorway to try and set it off. It looks unnatural because of the perspective of the camera.

EDIT: It's just around 0:13 in the video. Just as she's stepping back from the buttons you can see the door begin to close, stop, then go back into the wall.

Ah yeah, watching it thinking this makes it less creepy. But why didnt she go to another elevator/ get back in as it closed (call the elevator back)?

EDIT Also though, if I were trying to set off the sensor to get them to close, it wouldnt consist of me peeping my head out the door quickly looking both ways

[–]MeloJelo 2 points 4 years ago* 
I don't know if it's just an old elevator, but she stands still for a good 20 seconds without crossing the threshhold, and the hold door button usually only lasts for like 5 seconds.

Also, her waving her arms isn't the weird movement. That starts at about 1:57, where her arms and wrists begin twisting and writhing in weird gestures, and she's completely outside the threshhold, so it doesn't look like she's testing for a motion sensor.

It looked to me like she was playing hide and seek or something. Maybe she fucked up the elevator by pressing all the buttons, which is why it stayed open. It looked like she was playfully hiding in the elevator, and was waiting for a friend to come running around a corner or something.

Then perhaps she saw whoever she was playing with, and was telling them the elevator wasn't closing or working.

I don't know, I don't think it's anything supernatural. Playing hide and seek, or just playfully hiding from someone seems more reasonable. It could explain how she ended up on the roof in the water supply. Trying to hide, accidentally fell in a drowned? I don't know details, just trying think of a logical explanation because it seems the internet has taken this thing to another level of supernatural conspiracy.

[–]buster2Xk 1 point 4 years ago 
Someone came up with a pretty good theory about her losing her glasses, mashing buttons on a certain row to try and get to her own floor, then being confused when she hits the button to keep the elevator open and trying to signal for someone outside the elevator, but there isn't anyone to help her. So then she gives up and leaves. It made perfect sense and explained the whole elevator thing.

If you like I can try and find the comment I'm talking about. If I can't find it I will watch through the video again and try to explain each thing that happens from memory.

No idea about her actual death though.

[–]XdannyX 3 points 4 years ago 
Explain this:

Elevator door takes about 6 seconds to go from open to closed as evidence from the video. I understand that shes hopping in and out a lot but there are plenty of intervals where it should have closed. I have no answer for that, everything else has an answer but that. My best explanation, not involving something supernatural, the person that killed her(or a just someone in general) is standing outside pushing the call button over and over again.

[–]capgras_delusion 1 point 4 years ago 
You're looking at the wrong thing. It doesn't matter how long it takes for the doors to slide shut.

Rather, you'd need to find out how long the doors stay open after the internal 'open door' button or external call button is hit, and how long the doors stay open after the door frame sensor is tripped. Those delays happen before the doors start to shut and you can't tell those things from the video.

Newer elevators have ways to make sure the car isn't stuck for too long on one floor. But this is an older elevator in a crappy hotel. She could have glitched it and gotten it stuck by pressing all those buttons and running in and out. Equally likely is that the 'open door' button and door frame sensor simply made the door stay open for long enough for her to get herself stuck by repeatedly triggering the delays.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]XdannyX 3 points 4 years ago 
Her killer works for the hotel, tells her there's a cool secret room hes taking her to. She goes into the elevator thinking its the room. He knows about the cameras inside so just stands outside pushing the button over and over so she cant leave and the door stays open. Finally he's able to draw her away and she follows him to the water tower.

That was a good read; lucid interpretation. What do you make of the funky coincidence? The TB outbreak a block away, the TB testing kit is allegedly called the LAM-Elisa. You can strike the Black Dahlia and Dark Water film plot connections pretty quick, but the TB thing is just weird.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]capgras_delusion 3 points 4 years ago* 
Ready for another long post?

I think it's a crazy coincidence that the test is called LAM-ELISA.

However, before the story gained such a following, I'd guess that the test result would come up as one of the first results for Elisa Lam. Even now, if you google Lam Elisa instead of Elisa Lam, most of the results deal with TB. The similarity would be fairly easy to discover.

Now, TB. Tuberculosis is not that rare. There are a few thousand cases in California every single year (down to ~2,200 in 2012 from ~5,400 in 1992). Here's a PDF report from the California Department of Public Health.

Based on that table, you can see the LA has a significant percent of the TB cases. There are a few reasons for this. LA is the most populated city in California and TB is more common in overcrowded areas. People who use drugs, have weakened immune systems, live in poverty, and have a poor diet are more likely to develop TB after being exposed to the bacteria. In other words, the hotel itself would be a perfect place for TB to spread, and it's not surprising it happened in the same general area.

The fact that an outbreak happened a block away within a few weeks makes sense by the numbers. LA had more than 600 cases of TB in 2012. If a TB outbreak happened five blocks away two weeks earlier, people would read into that. Or if it happened a month later and three blocks away.

The thing is that LA would continue to have TB outbreaks in the hotel area if Lam never visited, and she would always share her name with the test. It's only 'significant' because of where she died. It would also be 'significant' if she died of TB or she became an infectious disease specialist or robbed a hospital with TB kits or whatever.

To me, the only crazy coincidence is that she shared her exact name with the test, not that she was sort of close to a TB outbreak.

An ELISA is a common bio test. Home pregnancy tests are ELISAs, and the name is an acronym. With that in mind I think it's just a coincidence that the dead girl's name was Elisa. Elissa (with a bonus 's') was the name of the Queen of Carthage#Virgil.27s_Aeneid) in the Aeneid. I'm sure there are some parallels that could be drawn between the two, but they're about as worthwhile (in my mind) as the connection between a dead girl and an ELISA.

Actaully, though you make a good point, there is a high chance she was on LSD or another halucinogen, as they tend to pass through and out of the body after 3-5 days, she was found two weeks later, and the way she acts is extremely similar to someone having a bad trip. Again though, you make a good point, i just wanted to add perspective.

As a result, people with bipolar disorder who have psychotic symptoms are sometimes wrongly diagnosed as having schizophrenia, another severe mental illness that is linked with hallucinations and delusions.

Do you know if BD is also associated with bizarre ticks and movements like she exhibited toward the end of the video? I've only seen that in paranoid schizoprhenia, but I'm not super well-versed on bipolar disorder.

I came back today to add the thought that I don't believe you that you have a mood disorder. If you did then you might object to people taking outlier symptoms described only with the heavy use of qualifiers, and applying them universally to all people with a mood disorder so common that it's nearly ubiquitous in every social setting.

The fact that you and your gang have gone through this thread violating reddiquette to stilt your own opinion with downvotes rather than behave like sensible people only further entrenches my perspective.

See, were you actually a person with a mood disorder then you might object to the stigma of your condition being worsened intentionally just so that some unsolved case wrapped in urban legend could be explained. You might have a more meaningful objection than to split hairs over somebody's word choice. That's what we call "grasping at straws".

The only reason that I have come back to state this is that after a day's thought about this discussion, I figure that if I'm wrong then you might want it pointed out that you're acting against your own best interest. More likely, you're just a troll pretending to be an expert in a condition you don't have while you're not a psychiatrist and have apparently never been in a position to learn about it for the benefit of anybody close to you.

At least your user name is accurate.

I have bipolar disorder, and again, it's an oversimplification because people won't read a novel on the Internet; especially when being corrected.

No, simplification is not damaging to us. Having people misunderstand what we live with, who we are, and what that can mean to those whose lives we are a part of does have an effect on us. Say, people might start believing that hallucinations are part of the diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder and then refuse to hire us. Frankly, the stigma is bad enough without people spreading bullshit, and I can explain in what way it is better to understate than to overstate the condition's characteristics.

All that matters where people without the disorder are concerned is how we will seem in our affect. Nothing beyond that has any bearing on their lives whatsoever. Look at it through the lens of somebody doing the hiring some place. They need to know that some days you'll seem down but will be able to push yourself into gear. That's it. That's all they need.

What they don't need are a bunch of conspiracy theorists, in attempt to explain some pop culture mystery, running around online taking wild guesses that everybody with bipolar disorder hallucinates and suffers from delusions, with or without the justification of rare outliers who also suffer from a comorbid psychotic condition. That is why I said something, and I don't appreciate straws being grasped at to make me look wrong over something so incredibly simple and obvious that there's no gain and no need for it.

False on the door thing, you can see in the video they push outward.

During WWII, an American airplane crashed near the Japanese island of Chichijima. There were nine servicemen on board. One was rescued by an American submarine. The other eight were taken in by the Japanese. Eventually, the Japanese ended up EATING those servicemen.

But that's not the weird part. The one serviceman who was rescued? That was George H. W. Bush.

There were multiple planes that were shot down. Not just Bush's. Another crazy part of the story is when one plane got hit and the pilot thought it was going down, so he ordered his men to evacuate and parachute down. After they jumped however, the pilot was able to regain control of his plane and limp back to his carrier. The crew who bailed out of his plane were captured, executed, and eaten. Talk about some guilty feelings for the pilot.

Yea I just commented on that. There were only 3 total. No one knows what happened to the other 2. Cannibalism of Flyboys consisted mainly of torture and then at times eating their livers to 'gain their strength'. Flyboys were detested due to their very successful bombing campaigns.

Looks like OP combined two stories. http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/20/cp.00.html

Bush was shot down in a 3 seater. And yes he was prisoner on that island. But it wasn't his crew, it was a total of 8 other POW's that had their livers eaten.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]DarthUSC 1 point 4 years ago 
Yes the OP was mistaken. There were several planes that were shot down over the island over about a week that this happened to. If you would like to read a great book on the subject I would recommend Flyboys by James Bradley.

I trust Wiki less than historical sources. 3rd link says that the sub that saved Bush, may have saved other people throughout the war.... that doesn't contradict the story at all.

But w/e, I know reddit loves wiki, I just know it cannot be used academically for anything, while most historical sources can. GL!

[–]BritishHobo 1 point 4 years ago 
Isn't the whole point of Wikipedia that things have to be verified by sources to appear on there? You just check the sources and scrutinize those.

The point is not to take Wikipedia on its word. Same as with everything else.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Emperor_Mao -1 points 4 years ago 
Um Wiki's own motto is "The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit". Universities won't accept stuff from wiki, because it can be changed by so many different people.

Although many lecturers I know have said Wiki is generally close to accurate, because there is a chance someone can edit something in without inaccuracy, it is not academically suitable. Though I will admit, for obvious stories with LOTS of sources, wiki saves a ton of time.

Ultimately though I know this is reddit, and who cares about being academically suitable. Wide reaching anecdotal stories are ever present, shitty news sources are often cited as "factual", and we basically upvote what we want to be right instead of what is right. Regardless I still think when it comes to a category of story telling that is hard to confirm, wiki should raise red flags even here.

[–]BritishHobo 0 points 4 years ago 
That's what I mean though - check Wiki's sources, as you would with anything else. That's my point.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Emperor_Mao 0 points 4 years ago 
If you actually go to the sources, they don't confirm or contradict the popular story. Wiki itself does not even contradict anything (the story is 1/2 told).

The wiki story reads like a patchwork, which makes sense, since it is just a bunch of random sources pasted together in a nonacademic fashion.

Well, NONE OF THEM could eject because this was an Avenger. And there were other aircraft too, but I believe the term you were looking for was "Bail out" but then again that is unlikely since there were three of them all captured. This means that they most likely had to ditch.

Just my 2 cents.

taken directly from his source link...

ZAHN: Bush knew he had to stay out of enemy hands. But he had no idea just what capture on Chichijima would have meant. The island was the site of some of the most horrific atrocities in the Pacific.

KENNEL: That's the tree right there.

ZAHN: Two months before Bush's mission, Bill Kinnel was shot down over Chichijima on his first ever-combat mission and captured by the Japanese.

KINNEL: I was tied to this tree and I spent the night here. And a local man came up and said that I had killed his son. And he placed a rifle barrel right between my eyes and he was going to shoot me. But fortunately, the guards chased him away. ZAHN: Kinnel was tied to two different trees for as long as 14 hours at a time.

KINNEL: I realized how lucky I was to have survived the eight days that I was here.

It seemed like almost yesterday that -- that it all happened.

ZAHN: He would be the last American to leave the island alive. Those who came after would face even more brutal treatment and a horrific death. Their stories are chronicled by James Bradley in his book, "Flyboys."

BRADLEY: You always hear the phrase, "against the Geneva Convention." That the Japanese did disobeyed the Geneva Convention. Ridiculous, they didn't consider the Geneva Convention. When the emperor declared war on the United States, he specifically left out any mention of honoring international agreements.

ZAHN: Without international protections, Japanese officers on Chichijima, like Major Suo (ph) Matoba were able to commit crimes so horrible, they hadn't even been specifically outlawed in the rules of war.

BRADLEY: And in this guy's twisted, brutal mind, the Japanese spirit could be fed, could be heightened by the killing of American POWs. And then subsequently, actually consuming their livers in terms of getting the spirit out of the enemy.

ZAHN: By the war's end, eight flyers had been killed on Chichijima, most by beheading. After many executions, a Japanese doctor was brought in.

BRADLEY: The doctors had to cut open the American on the orders of an officer, even though they found it very objectionable and did not want to perform this type of thing.

ZAHN: Matoba was most interested in the Americans' livers.

BRADLEY: He would have these livers prepared and cut up into tiny bits. You really didn't know what the meat was. And he would serve it at parties, and serve it onto other officers who were eating it unknowingly.

ZAHN: After Japan's surrender, Matoba faced capital charges at a war crimes trial on Guam.

BRADLEY: Immediately at the end of the war, he asked everyone to cover up. He was embarrassed by his behavior. And he apologized in the course of the trial, but the facts were the facts, and he was hung.

[–]Outofreich 3 points 4 years ago 
This is from a book called 'Flyboys' which chronicles what happened. It's a great/harrowing read if you like history. Basically, the Japanese commander of Chichijima was a raging alcoholic and sociopath. He was convinced that if he ate the livers and other organs of the men he would gain their strength, so they were beheaded and cooked up. Also George H.W. Bush was shot down and swam to a tiny uninhabited island where he was later spotted and rescued by an American boat.

[–]Fallenangel152 2 points 4 years ago 
Unsure. I think there was a lot of stories about the Japanese being barbaric. It was often said that they hung prisoners upside down from trees and used them for bayonet practice. How true it is I don't know.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]exgiexpcv 2 points 4 years ago 
Could be in part for the meat, but also the belief (originally from China, I believe) that one of two souls the body has resides in the liver. So by eating the liver the commanding Japanese officer believed that he was fortifying his soul and the souls of his men.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]alongdaysjourney 1 point 4 years ago 
Two prisoners were beheaded in a public ceremony and per an account in Time Magazine, their livers were immediately cut from their bodies and served as sukiyaki .[4] It was not disputed that eight prisoners of war were executed, and some of the bodies were butchered by the division’s medical orderlies and portions were eaten by the senior staff of the Japanese garrison.

If you read what he linked, one of the Japanese commanders believed that by eating the liver you absorbed that person's strength. He would have it chopped up and fed unknowingly to other officers.

Read the book "Flyboys" by James Bradley, you'll get your answers. But to some it up, it was considered tradition to eat the liver of a slain enemy in some fringe sects of Japanese Military culture.

The fireball from the crashed aircraft's exploding fuel tank skewered the bodies, turning the tragic scene into an appetizing, festive barbecue. The Japanese soldiers that arrived at the scene later reported that they have new respect for American food.

It reminds me of the story of a World War I vet who says that he had an injured Adolf Hitler in his cross-hairs and decided not to shoot (if this story is true).

EDIT: It was possibly this guy, but seeing as the story actually came from Hitler himself it was probably bullshit.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Khnagar 76 points 4 years ago 
It might possibly be true, though it's impossible to verify to any degree of certainty. It's generally thought to be a legend, and the british soldier never knew or claimed it was Hitlers life he had possibly spared, if you want to believe the story.

[–]Golden_showers 4 points 4 years ago* 
If I remember correctly, it was Hitler who recognised the man in a painting and said something like, "that man was so close to killing me, I thought I'd never see Germany again". But it's possible that Hitler said that just to further imply that he was ment to survive and fulfil his objectives. Correct me if I'm wrong though.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 7 points 4 years ago 
Stephen Fry makes a point for that in Making History, and, as terrible as it sounds, I think he's right. Hitler, the Third Reich and the Holocaust served as a carthasis for the old european and world order and made our socities better.

perma-linksaveparent

[–]demostravius 3 points 4 years ago 
Quite possibly. There would have been no massive push for nuclear weaponry so wars would still be rife, Europe would not have unified which in turn drastically affected world peace.

Though honestly if he didn't exist I think someone else would have just taken his place and something similar would have happened.

Most likely not true Hitler was indeed in the army but when he was a young kid in his teens and not a fighter. There were many rows of trenches leading all the way up to the front line. His job was a runner sending messages between commanders in the back lines not up in the front.

[–]cosmicsans 2 points 4 years ago 
Which reminds me of the WWII story about a completely shot-to-shit American Bomber that was on it's last limb. Aparently, a lone Luftwaffe fighter plane came across the plane, escorted it out of German airspace, and then left.

perma-linksaveparent

[–][deleted] 39 points 4 years ago* 
There's this old thing that Christians used to post a lot about some kid in school who argued with a teacher and "proved the existence of God" and it ends with "That student's name? Albert Einstein." even though it never really happened. I'll see if I can find it.

edit: found it

The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, "Yes, he did!"

"God created everything? The professor asked.

"Yes sir", the student replied.

The professor answered, "If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.

Another student raised his hand and said, "Can I ask you a question professor?"

"Of course", replied the professor.

The student stood up and asked, "Professor, does cold exist?"

"What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?" The students snickered at the young man's question.

The young man replied, "In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."

The student continued, "Professor, does darkness exist?"

The professor responded, "Of course it does."

The student replied, "Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."

Finally the young man asked the professor, "Sir, does evil exist?"

Now uncertain, the professor responded, "Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil."

To this the student replied, "Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light."

The professor sat down.

The young man's name — Albert Einstein.

[–]railmaniac 85 points 4 years ago 
I personally like the MURICA version better:

A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

”How old is this rock, pinhead?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”

”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

Michael Dukakis tried to eliminate the myth that he was a pansy, weak, left-wing dove. So, he tried to copy Margaret Thatcher's tank stunt, but it backfired horribly, and the GOP used the silly image of Dukakis in the tank to make fun of him. It's considered to be the biggest political gaffe ever.

Your version of the events is inaccurate. According to your source there were only 3 servicemen aboard President Bush's plane. The other two died on impact and Bush swam to safety. There were many prisoners held on the island. Only 8 were killed and a rogue officer served the LIVERS of the men as sort of ritual feeding. Not their whole bodies.Your version was sensationalized it a bit.

Not quite.

JAMES BRADLEY: You always hear the phrase, "against the Geneva Convention." That the Japanese did disobeyed the Geneva Convention. Ridiculous, they didn't consider the Geneva Convention. When the emperor declared war on the United States, he specifically left out any mention of honoring international agreements.

Narrator: Without international protections, Japanese officers on Chichijima, like Major Suo (ph) Matoba were able to commit crimes so horrible, they hadn't even been specifically outlawed in the rules of war.

JAMES BRADLEY: And in this guy's twisted, brutal mind, the Japanese spirit could be fed, could be heightened by the killing of American POWs. And then subsequently, actually consuming their livers in terms of getting the spirit out of the enemy.

From the transcript it says Bush had only two other crewmembers on his plane, ejected from his plane and swam away from the island and was later picked up by an American sub. As is happens, the crewmembers hadn't ejected and went down with the plane; over the course of other missions during the war, eight flyers were taken as POWs, later killed and cannibalized by doctor. All the same, it's pretty chilling considering how different the world would be if he hadn't survived.

The link doesn't support your version of the story. It says 8 US servicement died on Chichijima OVER THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE WAR, most by beheading. It was certainly not the crew of the Grumman TBM Avenger which Bush bailed out of, which carred only a crew of three. Both died, and considering one was still in the plane and the other's parachute didn't open, it's unlikely either survived to be captured and then eaten.

Anyone interested in learning more about this, read "Flyboys" by James Bradley. He also wrote "Flags of our Fathers." The book really gives a great account of the Japanese mindset prior to and during the Pacific War. I never knew much about The Rape of China or what was occurring during WWII with Japan. It was a incredible, nonjudgmental view of that time.

I think you've got the facts a little messed up. There were about that many men captured during the bombing of chichi Jima, but not all on one aircraft. George Bush flew the Avenger, a 3 man plane. James Bradley (same author as Flags of our Fathers) wrote an incredible book about all that happened on and over Chichi Jima called Flyboys, I highly recommend it.

From my memory, there were two other men on the plane Bush was flying. He doesnt know what happened to them. Maybe the number is wrong but there is no evidence that they were eaten. Cannibalism of 'Flyboys' did happen. It just may not have occurred in this instance. What the Japanese leaders did was eat their livers for the most part. It was to gain their strength supposedly. They did much worse things to POWs and Flyboys though. Like force feeding them lbs of rice and making them drink water to expand their stomachs only to stomp on them and have them burst and slowly die. Cannibalism was mostly an issue in the Australian regions due to poor supply. They kept Allied POWs alive as they hacked away at them in order to keep the meat fresh, due to the heat. They'd keep them in pits and slowly eat them.

I recently read the book Flyboys by James Bradley, which covers the Chichijima incident and the war in the Pacific in great detail. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the story.

Also, nine servicemen were not on board Bush's plane - 3 were. He was the only one who survived, being rescued by a US submarine.

Another interesting part of the event is that one of the planes was hit bad and the people aboard thought it would crash... so 2 of the crew members parachuted out and were captured by the Japanese. The crazy part is that the plane didnt wind up crashing, the pilot wound up landing on an aircraft carrier. The 2 guys who were captured had the livers eaten. Sad stuff but it was not like this was a common practice among the Japanese, rather that of a few crazed and desperate officers.

Flyboys is extremely unbiased and shows both sides of the story. The US did some horrible things too (see the bombing of tokyo).

Ignore this. Turns out it was bad history. I'd like to take this opportunity to remind people (and myself) of the importance of proper fact checking, and that wikipedia is a really poor source.

EDIT: For the people who were asking what this originally was, it was a story about Japanese soldiers in WWII being slaughtered by crocodiles after being trapped in a swamp. /u/Bernadito has the full text in his post below.

perma-linksavegive gold

[–]Bernardito 765 points 4 years ago 
This is actually not true. It has been proven false since then.

The story never happened. It's complete fiction.

But Bernardito, wasn't it included in the Guinness Book of World Records? Doesn't Wikipedia confirm as true?

Here we get to the interesting part.

First, the truth: February 1945. It's the final stages of William Slim's brilliant Burma campaign and the British have trapped a Japanese force counting around a thousand men in the islands of Ramree. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese commander chose to take his men across an unblocked route through ten miles of mangrove swamps. Many were already in a bad state entering the swamp. Malaria was rampant. As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through. Out of 900 troops that went into the swamp, 500 made it out.

The myth: The above story except that by the end 20 troops were captured by the British, the rest were all killed by saltwater crocodiles. This is a 'reported account' from this encounter: "That night was the most horrible that any member of the ML crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left... Of about 1,000 Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were left alive."

Why is this a sensationalist myth?

The observer of this is according to most accounts a certain Bruce Wright who for some reason was in this swamp where this is said to have taken place, sitting in a motor launch and witnessing this. Yet only Wright's Wildlife Sketches Near and Far exists as the single account for this to have happened.

There is no other single source that can verify this event to have happened and the actual survivors themselves that came out of the swamp is enough to disprove this myth. There is no mention of it in official British records and W.O.G. Potts did his own research into this with an incredibly detail investigation in which he interviewed a broad range of people which included Ramree islanders, survivors and soldiers. No one acknowledged that an incident like this had taken place.

Lastly, historian Frank McLynn has this to say in his book The Burma Campaign:

Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with a exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).

The Wikipedia writer is overly critical about Frank McLynn in the article, for whatever reason that might be. While McLynn did indeed doubt the existence of Mr. Wright but as pointed out in the Talk section of the page in question, there is no evidence that the Wright who wrote the book which had the only account of the incident and the Wright which the Wikipedia page uses as a source (a dubious one at that) is the same person. Secondly, the Wikipedia page makes McLynn seem like someone making claims out of thin air which is ridiculous. He's using scholarly sources to back up his claim and is definitely not the only author doubting this story. (Just see Platt SG, Ko WK, Kalyar Myo M, Khaing LL, Rainwater T. Man eating by estuarine crocodiles: the Ramree Island massacre revisited. Herp Bull. 2001;75:15–18)

As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through.

I've lived in swamps my whole life, that's a pretty gross exaggeration. It's mostly just unpleasantly trudging through knee deep water, but it's not a nightmare.

Snakes pretty much leave you alone unless you step on them, corner them, or get in their nest.

Insect borne diseases are a big deal, but you don't need to be in a swamp for that, anywhere with standing water will do.

As for crocs I'm not totally sure, but if they're anything like gators they're just territorial and fairly skittish outside their territory. Gators do a lot of warning hissing and aggressive warning moves before attacking.

The hardest part about swamp hikes/rucks is the slow pace, thick brush, and navigating around the standing water. Progress is always slow, and a mile an hour isn't an unreasonable pace.

I'm guessing this had more to do with the malaria being rampant and being cornered by a superior fighting force than anything else.

Beautiful. This story sounded like so much bullshit. If you sent 1000 soldiers into the jungle with 1000 starving lions, i bet a thousand bucks maybe 100 people would end up getting eaten. At most, maybe 300. After they got their fill, they would just lie on their backs with huge erections and sleep (there is no science fact in this statement. I just want to imagine it like that.)

Not to disagree with you, because I am fairly sure most died of disease not crocodiles, but crocs have been known to kill and store food underwater. It's possible the crocs present killed more people than they intended to eat and simply stored them away for later.

Since we are talking about animals: a small anecdote about the Oceanic Whitetip Shark

Although primarily found offshore, this shark is considered potentially dangerous It is often the first species to be seen in waters surrounding mid-ocean disasters. During both World Wars, the oceanic whitetip shark was of major concern due to the high number of torpedoed boats and shot-down planes. The Nova Scotia steamship was sunk by torpedoes from a German submarine off the coast of South Africa. Close to 1,000 men were on board, however only 192 survived. It is believed that many of the fatalities were victims of the oceanic whitetip shark in what eyewitness accounts described as a "feeding frenzy".

Oh god yes. I read about this in one of Peter Hathaway Capstick's books, as an aside to how terrifying crocodiles are, when I was a young teenager. I grew up in an area with a lot of crocs and was always a bit obsessed with them, especially since a lot of my hobbies brought me into dangerous proximity with them. Suffice it to say, the story of Ramree captivated me. I wrote reports and short fiction stories on it for school but I've always wished someone with more talent would turn this into a novel or flesh it out into a historical fiction movie. The trouble is Australian cinema doesn't have Hollywood's production quality, and Hollywood doesn't do crocs well. Like at all. See Rogue and Lake Placid for examples. But this concept, this done well? Would be the absolute tits.

Eventually, Rathbone's mind deteriorated to the point that on Dec. 23, 1883, he decided to deck the halls with his family's blood. While serving as a U.S. consul in Hanover, Germany, Rathbone tried to kill his three kids, and when his wife stopped him, he fatally shot and stabbed her, then stabbed himself -- mentally replaying Booth's actions from 18 years earlier. The police found Rathbone covered with blood and completely out of his mind. According to a widely repeated but unconfirmed report, he claimed that there were people hiding behind the pictures on his wall.

Shanti Devi was born in Delhi, India in 1926. From the age of 4, she claimed to remember details of a past life of a married woman in Maruthia named Lugdi Devi. She also remembered being married to a man named Kedar Nath and dying ten days after giving birth to a child.

Eventually, her headmaster found a merchant named Kedar Nath living 145km away in Maruthia who verified every single one of these details. Further investigation involving an independent commission from Mahatma Gandhi and later a number of sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists gave further evidence that she was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi. The commission eventually concluded that she was the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi.

She recognized any family member of Lugdi's that she met as Shanti and even recited a number of details such as promises Kedar failed to keep on Lugdi's deathbed, money stashed in a secret place and the layout of furniture in their marital home before she died.

So far, there has been no scientific explanation of this case and many scientists still dismiss it (and similar cases) as fraud.

As I recall the Dyatlov Pass Incident is easily explained by an avalanche.

Was the type of radiation mentioned in some accounts ever identified? Was it superficial or penetrative? What we mean by this is was it something they touched or did it permeate their bodies? The reason that this is important is that it distinguishes between recent weapon use and merely background exposure.

Again, the short answer is: The radiation was superficial and this fact has been known for some time. It is generally irresponsible journalism that has exaggerated the importance of this aspect of the Dyatlov Pass case.

“The radiation referred to has been identified as beta-radiation with the characteristics of isotope K-40. This is very weak contamination and certainly superficial.”

According to various experts the radiation was minor surface contamination and probably from Lyudmila Dubanina’s coat. It was probably from a laboratory environment (Radium, Radon and Potassium) and not from any recent weapons use. A point has been made that prior to the moratorium on atomic weapons testing a fair number of detonations had been carried out in Russia and in other parts of the world. Again, it was not uncommon that small amounts of “fall-out” might be spread far and wide.

Edit: Other sources state that it was a thorium gas mantle in their lamps. In either case, definitely not creepy. Just life.

perma-linksaveparent

[–]himself_v 1 point 4 years ago 
First, "Radiation was false" and "Yes, radioactive contamination was detected but it wasn't that big of a deal" are different things. Radiation wasn't false.

Second, yes, it wasn't that big of a deal. It's not Chernobyl on their clothes. But neither it is something to hand-wave.

Third, on exactly how big of a deal it was, the report goes:

"For instance, part N4, a black sweater, at the moment of testing had 9900 beta-particle decays a minute on 150 cm2, and after thorough washing for 3 hours in our lab it had 5200 decays from the same area. For example I can say that our [lab's] sanitary rules require that beta-particle contamination from 150 cm2 should not be higher than 5000 decays/min, and after washing it should be equal to normal background state. [...] Your data indicates these clothes were in a water for a long time, i.e. already thoroughly washed though."

"[Could this contamination have happened without being in a contaminated place or environment]?"

"Absolutely not."

Another mystery here is why this test was even administered.

There was a Cracked article on this awhile back.

A detail the /u/prisoner216 left out was that many of the bodies were found naked. Believe it or not, it all explains away pretty nicely. The scattered bodies and broken limbs are, as /u/blaghart explained, easily explained by an avalanche and its aftermath. The missing soft tissue was likely consumed by a scavenging animal (since this happened up in the mountains, the bodies were preserved by the cold, so there was plenty to time between the incident and its discovery). The naked bodies were likely a result of Paradoxical Undressing, a documented phenomenon where hypothermia victims remove their own clothing. There was no evidence of radiation onsite, and was likely an embellishment added later.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]himself_v 5 points 4 years ago 
Cracked article was half wrong half hand-waving. Believe it if you want but investigate on your own. Short summary of what you get wrong: everything. There were no naked bodies, only partially undressed bodies, there's no mystery there: the survivors undressed them to get clothes. Scattered bodies have nothing to do with an avalanche: they tell a story of how the group moved and they were quite active all of them. Most of them died of hypothermia or from numb crushing blows received long after they left the camp. There were no signs of an avalanche although it is mentioned in the case files as a theory. The radiation test was requested, administered, and confirmed radiation.

Here are the case docs, check it with google translate or something.

Indeed. Avalanche explanation alone does't hold any water, and people don't care enough to question it or investigate. It could have been a fear of avalanche + stupid actions + internal conflicts in the group, but this case is definitely not so simple as cracked painted it.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Galaxity 1 point 4 years ago 
It really does. The avalanche theory is the most likely conclusion AFTER QUESTIONING the situation and all the facts. They thought the avalanche was coming towards them but it wasn't.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]himself_v 3 points 4 years ago 
This is better but still not enough. Short summary of events:

9 of them left the tent without being fully dressed and made it ~1km downhill to the safe place. In that time, one of them was apparently lost and eventually died. He was later discovered to have blunt skull trauma at this point.

The remaining 8 started to collect wood and make fire. Eventually two of them went back to the tent and died from hypothermia on the way, one earlier, another one later.

So far this suggests really bad weather, but skull trauma? Wtf. This calls for actual avalanche, but apparently there was none. Others had no injuries at this point, and the stuff in the tent was later found intact. The photos from eariler in that tent show no signs that any of them had injuries.

The remaining 6 made fire but it didn't help. Two more of them were found dead at the site of the fire. Corpses were slightly burnt where they were lying close to the fire, which means the fire was still burning after their death.
By this time I'm wondering just what kind of extreme weather it was that 5 top class hikers died in like 45 minutes by simply being outside. They weren't wet, they were mostly dressed - not completely, but they certainly weren't nude.

The 4 survivors made a snow burrow to hide from the wind. They hid there and still were found dead. They didn't die of hypothermia: instead, all of them died from crushed ribs and skulls, and these injuries supposedly happened after they left the tent (experts said they would not be able to walk for long with them). This probably means their burrow came down on them.
So there's at least four mysteries here, not counting the radiation: 1. Just what kind of weather it was? Weather data from that time did not indicate anything particularly disastrous, 2. What happened that they left the tent? There probably was no avalanche, could have been a fear of avalanche, but why injuries? 3. What happened in the burrow? 4. Why top class hikers failed so utterly in saving their lives?

Sure, all of this can kinda sorta be explained by various bad luck but it's not so simple as cracked paints it to be. It's not just "Avalanche did it".

As for the missing eye and tongue, what do you think scavenger animals eat first?

Any exposed flesh, I'd imagine. I've always wanted to ask whether the lady's eyes & mouth were open or closed (in which case the animals would go for something easier to eat instead of specifically aiming to get the tongue & eyes out), and whether the area around the eyes & mouth showed signs of bite marks or if the organs were removed cleanly. I've never read anything on the Dyatlov Pass incident that mentioned either of those.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]lead_me 1 point 4 years ago 
If you dig you can find the actual autopsies online. Dubinina's upper lip was apparently damaged, and all of her nose cartilage was gone, as well. So probably her face was eaten a bit by some passing animal. It does not, much to everyone's disappointment, speculate how the tongue was removed.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]TheDemonClown 1 point 4 years ago 
Just the nose cartilage? Not the skin, too?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]lead_me 2 points 4 years ago* 
Skin, too. Basically, her face looked pretty skeletal.

I think the most intriguing thing about the autopsies is that they reveal that every one was banged up. More so than is often implied in reports and articles. In fact, the two men who were found ascending back up to the tent both had injuries on their hands and fingers consistent with punching and hand-to-hand combat.

I've researched it quite a bit and I think it might be possible that there was a drunken brawl over one of the women or something. Then again, a lot of the injuries were described by the doctor as not consistent with an injury that could be delivered by a human being, and how would a simple brawl lead to them all running down the hill? Also, the footprints from the tent down to the hill, were single-file, with the tallest at the back. Implying cooperation and a controlled descent. That's the thing with this case... every theory that begins to seem plausible has some glaring error or flaw.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Renato7 11 points 4 years ago 
If there was an avalanche then why was the tent standing seemingly fine out in the open? Also how could the scavengers get to the bodies when they were found covered in several feet of snow?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]mydogisarhino 8 points 4 years ago 
Maybe, but that doesn't explain how their tents were torn open from within, and they still had tracks away from them. If the culprit were an avalanche, the campsite would have been more throughly disturbed (tents and supplies more broken/half buried) and no tracks seen (unless they left after the avalanche had occurred).

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]super_pickle 2 points 4 years ago 
Obviously they left after the avalanche occurred. They were in the tent, it was hit by an avalanche, they tore it open and ran out in a panic. Look at the pictures, it looks exactly like a tent that had been hit with a huge wall of snow.

Landscape is too flat for avalanches. Besides, their tent was on top of the hill. Also, there are lot of other creepy details.

Not just hypothermia - it's something called "altitude sickness", which explains why all their clothes were off and such (for some reason, lots of people take their clothes off despite sub zero temperatures).

And because I just know someone if going to try and bring up the radiation...there wasn't any. Their skin was orange because it was incredibly sunburned.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]himself_v 1 point 4 years ago 
Clothes weren't off, mostly. Two of them were partly undressed which is no mystery: others took their clothes when they died. Some had no footwear, probably because they were sitting in the tent, and then had to leave in a hurry.

The skin color is apparently not a major mystery either.

But there was radiation.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]shakakka99 2 points 4 years ago 
It also explains why some of them were half naked. Whatever clothing wasn't stripped away by the avalanche was shredded off by scavengers.

The Russian investigators that found the site were familiar with avalanche indications and found none. Also their footprints fleeing the tent were well preserved enough to see that some were barefooted prints and other were made by feet in only socks. It was something like -10 that night and experienced skiers like that party would have know to leave the tent for longer than an hour would mean certain death. They fled their tent only because they were more certain they would die if they stayed but no one knows the reason...

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]blaghart 0 points 4 years ago 
They fled their tent with no clothes, which is in keeping with hypothermia. Hypothermia fucks with your brain something fierce, meaning that you feel very hot and are likely to disrobe and wander off.

All 9 at exactly the same time? Not one would have enough fits to stop the others? And the footprints indicate running not wandering.

considering they'd all be exposed to the same below zero temperatures and all just have survived an avalanche it's not that hard to conclude they'd all be suffering the same condition.

You mean like they're experiencing hypothermia. Which is usually caused by a sudden drop in temperature like, say, a blizzard or high winds, which would blow away any snow deposits from an avalanche that would have caused all the crushed bones.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]helljumper230 1 point 4 years ago 
What? You are saying an avalanche made them cold, but was blown away and then the weather calm enough to leave footprints that were still recognizable weeks later?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]blaghart 1 point 4 years ago 
Not even remotely what I'm saying. I'm saying an avalanche hit, then a blizzard, making the survivors hypthermic and blowing away the snow. In their hypothermic daze they removed their clothes and fled, dying of exposure. The footprints come after the snow is deposited. Even then, the fact that there were survivors indicates the avalanche didn't bury them very deep, if at all. It just hit and sprayed, like a wave hitting a building.

Which is in keeping with an avalanche. The snow moves like a wave and settles out, then the blizzard blows all the snow away, exposing them to the elements. Couple that with the fact that the survivors were clearly exposed to the cold since they wandered off in a hypothermic state and you have your explanation.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

According to the wiki page they were found under several feet of snow 13 feet down in a ravine. They also said there had been no precipitation between the deaths and finding the bodies. So it seems unlikely that scavengers would have been able to get to them

perma-linksaveparent

[–]blaghart 1 point 4 years ago 
Scavenger birds? Maggots? Coyotes and quadrupedal scavengers can scale ravines you know.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 1 point 4 years ago 
Can scale ravines and then dig down into 4 meters of snow and hide all trace? I mean I will admit that I only read the wikipedia article and would not be surprised at all if stuff like "evidence of decay brought about by maggots as well as tracks of coyotes and bird droppings all suggest that the missing eye and tongue were the result of scavengers" were intentionally (or unintentionally) excluded in order to keep the air of mystery about the story--everyone loves a good mystery. But at the same time, I would imagine there would still be maggots present if the missing organs were consumed by them and why would other scavengers such as carrion and coyotes only eat the tongue and eyes when they are big and presumably hungry enough to dig through more than 12 feet of snow for a meal? Maybe that part was simply unclearly written in the article, and there had in fact been snow fall between death and corpse discovery but even still I don't imagine in the winter with heavy snow fall that most scavengers would leave what is essentially a sack of food mostly untouched and instead enjoy the gourmet of the eyes and tongue of only one of the corpses and then move on to find more food.

Hypothermia induces a state wherin you feel very, very, very hot. Which is why they abandoned their clothes (can't remember the name of the condition atm, but doubtlessly it's on wiki) Also I don't recall there being evidence of which way the tent was torn, considering avalanches do tend to send things rather everywhere.

No it really wouldn't, at least not by requirement. Considering that at subzero temperatures it wouldn't take much to induce hypothermia and even a small avalanche (one capable of encasing them in snow without burying them totally) would be enough to crush bone and trap people...which would force them to cut their way out and escape. Plus being buried in the snow would induce hypothermia quite rapidly, which would explain why they felt "hot" and left without their winter clothes.

Because they didn't leave until after the avalanche? Why is this so hard for everyone grasp, they act like they left camp before getting snowed in.

[–]SandKitty 1 point 4 years ago 
I'm still skeptical to be honest, there just isn't enough to back up that theory. I don't have a better theory though, there are some things that don't add up. The people investigating the scene would have most likely been able to identify the scene of an avalanche. From looking at some of the pictures the camp doesn't appear to be covered in a thick layer of snow which they would have to trudge through after an avalanche destroyed their tent. And the idea that hypothermia caused delusions before the experienced hikers could gather their wits and return to the tent for the rest of supplies is just kinda seals the deal for me. I don't argue that they could have thought there was an avalanche and in their panic abandoned camp, but still not explanation as why they did not return. I'm no expert on the subject, I've just read a bunch and looked at pictures.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]blaghart 1 point 4 years ago 
Yes I can tell, since you're unfamiliar with what hypothermia does to you. They started feeling like they were overheating, fleeing the site of their camp after whatever killed their comrades, and then they underwent either Terminal Burrowing, trying to find cover under ledges and things, or they collapsed in the snow as their limbs gave out due to the cold. At those temperatures they would have frozen to death in minutes, no time to go back.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]SandKitty 1 point 4 years ago 
I did know about paradoxical undressing and the delusional and sluggish acting, actually. It's something I took into account since it's kindof the logical step, and could very well have happened with them. Also, I live in temperatures that are consistently lower than what was recorded for that night and just minutes outside without proper clothing would not cause delusional hypothermia fast enough for your explanation to make sense.

There was definitely cannibalism. The book they talk about in the wiki really goes into detail about it. I went to a talk recently about women pioneers in the area, and the speaker pointed out how odd it is that there's a picnic area there. I'd never thought about it until then, and we definitely stopped for lunch there when I was a kid at least once.

The Donner party was a result of Jim Bridger, the guy that basically made the western expansion possible.

"In 1846, Bridger was at least partially responsible for the tragic journey of the Donner Party, due to his self-interested misdirection of the wagon train through the impractical Hastings Cutoff. Bridger had hoped that the party's successful trip would help bring increased trade to his Fort Bridger, and actively worked to obscure evidence that might hamper this increase in business."

You forgot the part where they were partially undressed. But that's a known paradoxical reaction to hypothermia, people go crazy and oddly remove their clothing in delirium. That's a documented reaction outside this case.

And really since it's far less easy to explain their state of undress any other way, it's pretty likely they were experiencing hypothermia delirium. In which case that's pretty much it. Their bodies were scavenged by animals (pretty much a given). Broken skull, well that's probably the initial avalanche, or maybe someone with hypothermia got violent or another delirious person thought they had to end their suffering with a rock.

[–]himself_v 5 points 4 years ago 
Only two of them were partially undressed and that is no mystery: others took their clothes after death, probably. (At least this simple explanation itself has no flaws in it; if it's allowed by your preferred global explanation is another question).

But if you study the case properly, you'll see they weren't delirious: their actions as a group were mostly smart. They produced some wood and made a fire; after that didn't help (for some reason people continued to die), the remaining four people made a snow burrow which should have saved them from the wind. They had all chances to live there but died: from the numb crushing blows, not hypothermia.

See for yourself if it's noteworthy or not (I'm serious: I'm not a radiation expert; but the linked resolution says it's "more than someone working with radioactive substances should have"). The avalanche part is not impossible but there's not particularly many signs of it actually happening.

[–]himself_v 1 point 4 years ago 
This was taken a month after the incident. The tent was still standing, stuff inside it was intact. People who left it were mostly uninjured, except for one guy who had skull trauma. If that was an avalanche, you'd expect there to be more damage to everything, won't you?

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Llaine 0 points 4 years ago 
What? The tent isn't standing at all, it's practically in tatters. Some of them died from internal injuries, and others from exposure. It doesn't have to be a huge avalanche, just enough to scare them from the tent into the wilderness with no clothes on.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]himself_v 2 points 4 years ago* 
It is not in tatters, it's covered with snow but standing. For example, Brusnikin (one of those who was first handling it) testifies that "It was covered with packed snow", and then goes on to wonder that something extraordinary must have happened if all hikers left the safest place around, the tent. In other words, after seeing and personally taking apart the tent, he (a hiker himself) did not as much as have a thought of avalanche as a reason.

Около 7 часов что-то необычное еще никем не виданное заставило туристов в панике покинуть палатку. Бежать разутыми, при плохой погоде ночью из единственного теплого уголка возможно только под страхом смерти.

"At around 7 o'clock something unusual, never before seen, made the hikers leave the tent. Running bare legged, in a bad weather at night, from the only warm place around - this is possible only under the fear of death."

Это странное явление (свет, проникающий через палатку, звук, возможно и газы) действовало в течение продолжительного промежутка времени, подгоняя туристов.

"This strange phenomenon (light shining through the tent, sound, or perhaps some gas) continued to act for a while, hastening the hikers."

Those are of course wild guesses, but if the tent was destroyed he'd say "the tent was obviously destroyed by an avalanche, so that's why they left".

Another one of those who handled it, Tempalov, says:

Остальных 4 студентов обнаружить не удается по настоящее время так как в горах имеется очень большой и толстый снег.

"The rest 4 students [corpses] could not be located as of yet, because there's a lot of very thick snow in the mountains". Indeed all the corpses that were located save for 2, were covered by thick snow.

Палатка была растянута на лыжах и палках, забитых в снег, вход ее был обращен в южную сторону, и с этой стороны растяжки были целы, а растяжки палатки с северной стороны были сорваны и вся вторая половина палатки была занесена снегом.

"The tent was set up on ski poles stuck into snow, its entrance facing south, and from that side its ridgepoles were fine. Ridgepoles from the north side were torn out and that part of the tent was covered by the [falling] snow".

By the way, Brusnikin in his report says the same and adds that "one of the ski poles, probably the one from the north side, was inside the tent, sawed into pieces. They must have had some serious reason to do so, because they had no spares."

And again Tempalov:

На первый взгляд палатка была занесена снегом.

"First impression is that the tent was covered by the [falling] snow". He uses the word "занесена" again which assumes normal ways by which the snow accumulates (falls from the sky, slowly arrives with wind etc).

Никаких следов борьбы в палатке мною не установлено. Если бы была какая либо борьба естественно, что-то бы мной было установлено.

"I found no signs of struggle in the tent. If there was any fighting, of course I'd notice something." I'm not sure why he repeats that but anyway, if the tent was destroyed, signs of fighting would probably be out of question.

[–]Llaine 0 points 4 years ago 
An avalanche may not have necessarily impacted their tent. Whatever forced them to leave the tent was likely loud. I don't see why they would cut their way out of a tent if they saw some light outside (as missile test theories tend to go).

I've never seen a better theory than avalanche. It doesn't fit every piece of evidence, but it fits most.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Unggoy_Soldier 1 point 4 years ago 
I maintain the vaguely plausible theory that the hikers were killed by an avalanche and/or subsequent hypothermia... initiated by a nearby nuclear test. The blast caused the avalanche, the avalanche killed the hikers, and blast left traces of radiation. Bear in mind this was Soviet Russia - a nuclear test is a reasonable explanation for the radiation and extremely tightlipped official response. And that's if the radiation report is even legitimate, which is debatable.

The worst part of the Donner Party was the gold rush 3 years later. An army had to travel up from Sacramento to eliminate the quite obvious signs of major cannibalism. Interestingly, because the men went out to hunt and cut wood, not a single child died, and only a few women died.

perma-linksaveparent

[–]McGravin 3 points 4 years ago 
Interestingly, because the men went out to hunt and cut wood, not a single child died, and only a few women died.

I'm not sure where you're getting your facts, but you're pretty off the mark. Hunting was largely unsuccessful as game was extremely scarce, and it was difficult to find enough wood to keep the fires lit. Your claim that not a single child died is completely false, as a number of children died, including Louis and Ada Keseberg, Margaret and James Eddy, and Isaac, Lewis, and Samuel Donner.

I get what you're trying to say, that the men did the work and therefore enabled the women and children to survive, and that's partly true. Of the original party, two thirds of the women and children survived, while only one third of the men made it. However, it may have as much to do with physiology as with who did what tasks.

The survivors were on average 7.5 years younger than those who died; children aged between 6 and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and children under the age of 6, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Keseburgs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths among males aged between 20 and 39 were "extremely high" at more than 66 percent. Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork.

The radiation part- first off you have it wrong, it was "high levels of radiation on their clothing".

I could find no other information, which is bullshit. What TYPE of radiation, what radioisotope?? Well, actually Google had some talk saying beta radiation, but none of this is clearly sourced.

There was speculation that thorium camping lantern mantles (propane, kerosene, Coleman fuel lanterns) could have done that. But thorium is alpha radiation.

Seriously, this big mystery yet you never identified the isotope? Did you just throw the samples out after hearing a beta-sensitive Geiger counter tick?

What PART of the clothing? It's important. Shoes obviously suggest something. Gloves, something else. Pocket, something else there too.

I think the creepiest true event involves Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, a Scottish-born psychiatrist who ended up working with the CIA. Long story short, Cameron sat in judgment of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials. Fast forward not even ten years and he's fast at work trying to wipe the minds of unsuspecting mental patients using electroshock therapy, LSD, sleep deprivation, and the relentless exposure of "patients" to continuous, meaningless audio tracks meant to "de-pattern" the human brain. Oh, at at the same time he was Chairman of the World Psychiatric Association and President of the American and Canadian Psychiatric Associations.

According to Wikipedia (which has a pretty good write up):

Naomi Klein states in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron's research and his contribution to MKUltra were not about mind control and brainwashing, but "to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources.' In other words, torture." She then cites Alfred W. McCoy: "Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Cameron's experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb's earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method."

One problem is that when a Senate committee was convened to investigate in the 1970's, it was revealed that countless files about the agency's covert medical experimentation were destroyed admittedly to protect agency employees:

There is virtually no drug-related MK-ULTRA material in the files, we gather? In terms of destruction of those files, the seven boxes of progress reports that I think you had recalled from the Archives and destroyed on 31 January, was a booklet called "LSD 25, Some Unpsychedelic Implications." Why did you decide to do that?

"It was a conscious decision that there were a whole series of things that involved Americans who had helped us with the various aspects of this testing, with whom we had had a fiduciary relationship and whose participation we had agreed to keep secret. Since this was a time when both I and the fellow who had been in charge of the program were going to retire there was no reason to have the stuff around anymore. We kept faith with the people who had helped us and I see nothing wrong with that."

The insanely creepy coincidence of the Titanic, and the book Futility, Wreck of the Titan, which was released 14 years before the Titanic sank. In the book they describe the titan as "the largest craft afloat and the greatest of the works of men".

Both the Titanic and the Titan was 800 feet long, British-owned, and sank after hitting an iceberg in the north atlantic, in april, around midnight.

He writes that the Titan crashed into the iceberg at 25 knots, 400 miles from Newfoundland. The titanic crashed into the iceberg at 22,5 knots, 400 miles from Newfoundland.

Both had too few lifeboats to save all passengers, however, the Titan had 4 more than the Titanic.

They were also both triple-screw ships.

The novella stated that if Titan rammed an iceberg head-on, only the first three compartments would flood and the ship would remain afloat. Titanic was designed to survive having four flooded compartments. It is speculated that had Titanic rammed the iceberg, it would have survived.

Both ships were instead ripped open along their starboard sides, although for different reasons.

WWI seemed to be destined to happen. Franz Ferdinand was in an open car parade through Sarajevo when a group of assassins planned to kill him. One of the assassins managed to throw a grenade but Franz's driver avoided it and blew up under the car behind them. The car sped away and the assassins dispersed. Ferdinand decided to go visit those injured in the bombing but his driver got lost and had to turn around. In doing so the car stalled, in front of a cafe, where one of the assassins was having a failure sandwich. He looked up, saw the archduke and his wife stuck in the car. He walked out, took out a pistol and shot them both dead. This moment of happenstance caused Central European powers to declare war on Serbia and what would become the allies of WWI

This moment of happenstance caused Central European powers to declare war on Serbia and what would become the allies of WWI

No... it gave Austria-Hungary an excuse to declare war on Serbia, something which the leadership had been itching to do for a while. This caused Russia to declare war on Austria, which caused Germany to declare war on Russia, etc... It wasn't a simply case of the two groups declaring war on each other. Italy was in the Central Powers but didn't support her allies and ended up fighting against Germany and Austria the next year.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Wheate 214 points 4 years ago* 
Nope. They found that the only thing missing - the nine barrels of alcohol - could have set off an explosion that made no sound, but would have set off a shockwave that blew all the doors / windows open. The crew would have been scared out of their wits, probably thinking the ship was haunted, and jumped in the life raft without grabbing their stuff. They then floated away, presumably dying of thirst

Edit: a lot of people have patiently tried to explain that explosions / shockwaves are sound, and I'm sorry: I used the wrong word. The explosion was a pressure wave, which is an explosion that damages practically nothing and leaves cool air behind. I cannot speak for the absence of vapor-smell, as pointed out by /u/procrastinata, and as for the door, perhaps someone shut it for some reason as they exited. However, this is the theory that makes the most sense to me, and I am sticking to it.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]procrastinata 161 points 4 years ago 
That is one of the more plausible explanations, though according to Wikipedia:

This theory's main flaw is that the boarding party found the main hatch secured. Upon going into the hold they did not report smelling any fumes or vapour, which would have still smelled very powerful by that point if this theory were correct. Nor did people who came aboard at Gibraltar and Genoa report smelling any vapours. There was no evidence of alcohol outside the barrels in the hold. What happened to this missing alcohol from the nine empty barrels is as much a mystery as what happened to the crew, although it could have gone missing at any stage of the journey, from before being put on the ship in New York to after Gibraltar.

Not to sound like a dick but you do realize that sound is literally just our ears registering differences in air pressure, right? Like, if an explosion went off with enough force to blow doors and windows out, you can be god damned sure that you'll hear it.

That is a ridiculous explanation. A barrel of alcohol doesn't just explode, nor do nine of them. We're not in a Hollywood movie. And somehow an explosion would have made the crew immediately decide the ship was haunted and leave it on the spot? Come on.

Also, here is an excerpt from the wikipedia article:

"Deveau returned to his ship and reported to the captain. Two men, Charles Augustus Anderson and Charles Lund, then boarded the Mary Celeste. The cargo of 1,701 barrels of alcohol was, Deveau reported, in good order. However, when it was eventually unloaded in Genoa, nine barrels were found to be empty."

The barrels were not destroyed, just empty.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–][deleted] 5 points 4 years ago 
The theory isn't that the barrels exploded. The theory is that the alcohol vaporized into the room (due to leaky barrels, I guess), reaching a concentration where it was explosive.

The often poorly-sealed barrels of high proof alcohol were believed to have been evaporating in the heat, filling the ship with a highly flammable vapour which was, at best, dangerous to breathe in and, at worst, would have blown the ship up if there was a spark or flame.

It has been suggested that the crew discovered this emergency and, after opening all hatches and windows, got into a lifeboat and tied a rope to the ship, letting them follow at a safe distance until the dangerous vapours had dissipated. This was standard practice.

But if that rope broke, the crew would have been lost at sea, with no way to return to the ship.

Elizabeth Bathory - "After her husband Ferenc Nádasdy's death, she and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls, with one witness attributing to them over 650 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80.[4] Due to her rank, Elizabeth herself was neither tried nor convicted, but promptly imprisoned upon her arrest in December 1610 within Csejte Castle, Upper Hungary, now in Slovakia, where she remained immured in a set of rooms until her death four years later.

The case led to legendary accounts of the Countess bathing in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, and subsequently also to comparisons with Vlad III the Impaler of Wallachia, on whom the fictional Count Dracula is partly based, and to modern nicknames of The Blood Countess and Countess Dracula."

I can explain it. Actually, I can just explain all of the reposts on reddit.

Ready? Set? Go.

So one person posts, "Here is a picture of my banana." Everyone upvotes it and it becomes stupidly popular. Other people realize they want fake internet points. They also post, "Here is MY banana!"

Now we have tons of banana posts.

They die down, a week or two later some idiot finds a random post about a banana and thanks, "Wow, I bet no one saw this! I better post that shit."

They post it, "Check out this banana!" The majority of Reddit has such a poor memory they don't fucking realize they just did this shit a week ago, so they all start posting bananas again. The cycle continues with literally EVERY POST.

The questions or topics that get brought up? Only the most common questions that people ask are ever asked. So they get asked repeatedly. By the time a question is posted, answered, and then buried in reddit someone comes along and thinks, "Oh I didn't see this question, I should post it! No one has EVER asked what happens at cheerleader camp!"

To me, all of the "the tinfoil hatters were right" reveals. That there was indeed a shady backroom of powerful people doing LIBOR fixing; that the financial crisis was done willfully and knowingly(e.g. Goldman trading against their own clients, many other internal memos from various places involved revealing many knew about the level of toxicity etc); or even things like the takedown of the bank of england by Soros.

Then all the reveals around "they really ARE watching our every move" NSA PRISM / full take capabilities, essentially rendering things like TOR dead. The willingness of everyone do do the secret angecy's work for them via facebook by detailing their every move, social connection and meaningful event, like and dislike. "Total self-surveillance aids total state surveillance" I guess.

Basically almost everything you always thought was too nuts to be true only to find out it was and then some.

IMO these are not just the creepiest true events, they also remain the most relevant and real world impacting things today.

[–]riskable 7 points 4 years ago 
Whoah there: There is no evidence yet that Tor is dead, cracked, or useless.

In the past Tor users have been discovered but every reported case so far stems from mistakes these people made while using it.

For example, a college student was suspected in some hacking incident and the FBI simply checked the school's network for Tor users, narrowed the list down to a few individuals, then the college student cracked under pressure.

If that student just kept silent they never would have been caught.

In the case of Dread Pirate Roberts the authorities merely watched and recorded every single post he made, narrowed down his profile, and connected the dots. In the thousands of posts he made there were descriptions of weather, certain locations, and other identifiable information.

So the lesson to be learned here is this: Spying on everyone at once doesn't solve any crime; real police work does.

There is only one real reason to spy on everyone at once: Power.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]Minedogemine 1 point 4 years ago* 
From what I understand the ability to "crack" TOR would require knowledge of all nodes in the network. With ever increasing capabilities of doing "full-takes" (every packet) this is basically a thing.

For the UK an example: "TEMPORA is the signals intelligence community's first "full-take" Internet buffer that doesn't care about content type and pays only marginal attention to the Human Rights Act. It snarfs everything, in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation without missing a single bit. Right now the buffer can hold three days of traffic, but that's being improved. Three days may not sound like much, but remember that that's not metadata. "Full-take" means it doesn't miss anything, and ingests the entirety of each circuit's capacity."

I am not knowledgeable enough for the details, but I don't think its unimagineable to have secret services co-operate enough at significant locations such at DE-CIX to Pokemon(gotta catch em all) TOR.

Here is a blog entry to translate in german that has some thoughts on TOR : http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=af0134f5

I guess in order for TOR to increase unsurveillability it would have to grow faster than the capability of secret services to log "the internet".

The real kicker really is that we have increasing worldwide government legislation that basically says every ISP has to log data for months; that ISPs have to give agencies increasing access on-demand. And in general, it is in the hands of co-operating governments of whether they choose to just add intrusive devices onto hardware as per the recent "btw, we bugged all of our own technology" reveal on an even larger scale.

Ironically enough, a lot of this is happening in free democracies and argued for the sake of freedom.

Operation Paperclip is a whole different load of creepy.

One thing is - why didn't they want the UK (their greatest ally) to use the scientists.

Two - without it how would the next 20 - 50 years pan out? America wasn't great, Scientifically, at the time - it is likely the space race would have been a failure and Russia would emerge the world's largest power. What would happen then? How would Asia (China) do without a major rise of capitalism?

Three - Was there, originally, something much more sinister behind this?

Bonus to this: America hadn't really cracked computing yet and the UK was much better suited to it. At the end of the war they basically took Computers from the UK and then asked them to not bother with them any more. If you know what I mean.

[–]iplaydoctor 1 point 4 years ago* 
Considering much of Soviet technological advancement during that time period was obtained via spies in the US, and to a lesser degree vice versa, I think they would have been pretty evenly advanced just as in the OTL.

Edit: I'm also not sure what is meant by not being great technologically... medicine/biology, industrial automation and manufacturing methods, atomic and modern physics!!!!!!!!!, aeronautical design (we just didn't have jets yet, but the P-51 was still a better aircraft than anything the Germans had), civil engineering/infrastructure, electrical engineering and power generation (as for electronics, I don't know enough about the early history, but it wasn't like Turing did all the work, there were very significant developments in the US, even IBM was doing some interesting work in the first half of the century), in all of these the US was number 1.

perma-linksaveparentgive gold

[–]mnmatt500 2 points 4 years ago 
medicine/biology

A lot of these technological bounds were occurring/ had been occurring on the other side of the atlantic.

atomic and modern physics

Atomic - America only made advancements (proper advancements) in this when Scientists from Europe, who felt persecuted by the nazis, left and to get as far away as they could they went to the USA.

Modern Physics - Again much more was being done in Europe than in the US.

civil engineering/infrastructure

See: Germany (1930-45), UK, France...

IBM was doing some interesting work in the first half of the century

IBM was dealing in general electronic goods and punch card machines. The real advancements were being done in UK, France and Germany. IBM expanded (then focused solely on) computing once the war was over and America had, frankly, stolen the European computing technologies.

A lot of the things you believe the US was number 1 at are simply because the institutions in which to pursue these sciences were more numerous. But Quantity != Quality.

aeronautical design

Even thinking of this, better ships were being built in the German and Royal Navy. Germany had the best submarines in the world. And Britain had the best architects. They got on a roll after the invention of the dreadnought which reshaped modern ship building for the foreseeable future.

Planes too! German and British planes were incredibly efficient. A lot of technologies for these planes were simply sold to America. E.g. Radar and Bubble cockpits.

Good question, it's creepy because it means that a good chunk of the advancements the allies have been so proud of could have come from the minds of Nazis, the same minds who contributed to the worst atrocities in history. Essentially it's creepy because we all condemn what the Nazis did but benefit from their experiments in ways most of us probably don't even know and our cultural, medical, psychological, scientific and technological make up is forever tainted with Nazism.

It's also creepy because the US wiped their identities and allowed former Nazis to live in their country and raise families without anybody ever knowing, effectively stabbing their own people and their allies in the back in their selfish desires to capitalize on Nazi intellectuals.

How about that time Russia might have almost accidentally started nuclear war and one guy prevented it because he didn't believe their early warning systems.

Shortly after midnight, the bunker's computers reported that one intercontinental ballistic missile was heading toward the Soviet Union from the U.S. Petrov considered the detection a computer error, since a first-strike nuclear attack by the United States was likely to involve hundreds of simultaneous missile launches in order to disable any Soviet means of a counterattack. Furthermore, the satellite system's reliability had been questioned in the past. Petrov dismissed the warning as a false alarm, though accounts of the event differ as to whether he notified his superiors or not after he concluded that the computer detections were false and that no missile had been launched. Later, the computers identified four additional missiles in the air, all directed towards the Soviet Union. Petrov again suspected that the computer system was malfunctioning, despite having no other source of information to confirm his suspicions. The Soviet Union's land radar was incapable of detecting missiles beyond the horizon, and waiting for it to positively identify the threat would limit the Soviet Union's response time to a few minutes.

Bonus nuclear creepy: the Russian Dead Hand system can launch a retaliatory nuclear strike in the event of a successful first strike destroying their leadership, with a network of sensors that listen for the signatures of nuclear attacks then launch communication rockets which tell everything else to just fire off all their nukes. It's still thought to be functional today but does have to be manually activated first, so it's good to know it probably won't be set off by a meteor impact.

First paragraph from wiki:

Hatteras Island (historically, Croatoan Island) is a barrier island located off the North Carolina coast. Dividing the Atlantic Ocean and the Pamlico Sound, it runs parallel to the coast, forming a bend at Cape Hatteras. It is part of North Carolina's Outer Banks and includes the towns of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras. It contains the largest part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. It is almost entirely in Dare County, North Carolina, but there is a very small sliver of about 45 acres (180,000 m2) which extends southwest into Hyde County.

The Lumbee people have an oral tradition saying that the Roanoke survivors were taken into their community. I don't think there's any reason to doubt it, considering that's what I would have done if I was a starving colonist and there were friendly natives nearby.

I daresay the only reason schoolchildren were ever taught that the colony had mysteriously vanished is because America had taboos about interracial marriage.

It is not 100%, but there have been documented accounts of finding blonde haired, blue eyed Native-Americans shortly after the Roanoke disappearance. The tribe called themselves Croatoans.

Early European colonies in America were very harsh and nasty places to live. Disease, starvation and severe punishment for not working hard enough were common. Plus there wasn't many women.

Walls and guards were put up to keep the colonist in rather than keep the natives out. Runaways were all too frequent.

The most reasonable explanation for Roanoke is that the workers killed their guards and melted into the surrounding native tribes.

Native NC'er here.

It's held that they ran out of supplies, the indians offered to move them ( the colony they set up is within eyesight of the beach, so you can guess how great that land is for farming ) and the colonists moved. Depending on who you ask, either Sir Walter Raleigh gave no fucks about the colonists, or they were convinced the Indian tribes had killed the colonists despite no bones or evidence of that fact being found at the site.

This and the whole " Blackbeard" thing are two out of three things that I sometimes hate about being a Tar Heel.

Yeah, they left a "mysterious" note and then a couple decades later there are accounts of the discovery that the local tribe had a few "mysteriously" fair-skinned members. Doesn't seem all that mysterious to me, lots of the early European settlers assimilated with the local indiginous people; doesn't seem all that bad to me, especially when the other option is starve/freeze to death.

[–]sweetwattah 441 points 4 years ago* 
In the 16th century, it was to be the first permanent English settlement on the American continent. Its proprietor, after a couple of years, was called back to England as the Queen summoned all available ships for war against Spain. When he returned, the colony was abandoned. No trace of them to this day has never been found. Only one clue has been left to guess their fate: The word "CROATOAN", which I believe was the name of a nearby island, was carved into a tree. Many theories have arisen over history as to what happened to them. I think that they most likely assimilated with the natives.

EDIT: Trying to recall stuff I learned some four years ago is tough.

Aren't blue eyes a non-domoinant genetic trait? Please excuse me if I'm wrong but if the majority of them had brown eyes the likelyhood of blue eyes is slim. Same applies for blonde hair, if I'm not mistaken. Unless by assimilation you mean they never really inter-married?

perma-linksaveparent

[–]borderline10 2 points 4 years ago 
I had to look this up, and this is the quote I found on Wikipedia:

"Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2.[8] The once-held view that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect. The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color

So it sounds like if one of the parents has blue eyes (like, for instance, a European), then the child can also have blue eyes, even if the other parent has brown eyes (a Native American).

The word "Croatoan" is an alternate spelling for the Croatan tribe of native Americans. Croatoan did later become the name of what is now Hatteras Island, the location of Cape Hatteras, NC. The fact that the word refers to the tribe, which was friendly and traded with colonists, further goes to support the idea of assimilation. I live on the NC coast, so this mystery has always fascinated me.

You need to look at it from an ethical standpoint: immoral actions should be punished. What kind of precedent does that set if you run horrific, inhumane, deplorable experiments, but the data you get is very valuable so then you are off the hook?

So what you're saying is 'all you have to do is be ordered to experiment on humans by a megalomaniac dictator running a world power who tries and fails to take over the world, and you can get away with it!'

Somehow I don't feel like there will be a lot of people lining up to take advantage of that precedent.

And you utterly fail to acknowledge the other side of the coin: here we have data that in some cases could end up saving tens of thousands of lives over the next fifty years (before medical science becomes good enough to figure it out sans-vivisection. Remember, this isn't all about nerve gas etc, there is a remarkable amount of useful data.) Now that this data exists, you are arguing that the chance that some other group might believe that their similar activities — but not ones ordered by a sovereign power run by a criminal madman, because let's face it, if you torture enough doctors you can find some who will experiment for you anyway — won't be punished, is large enough, and the potential result awful enough, to condemn both the scientists and those tens of thousands of people to die, the latter simply so justice can be served on the former.

This is what you call 'looking at it from an ethical standpoint', is it?

I'm not sure how you inferred that from what I said. Besides, even if they are ordered they could have refused--at least to some degree.

Somehow I don't feel like there will be a lot of people lining up to take advantage of that precedent.

I don't know why you feel like that. Wouldn't scientists working for dictatorial regimes be less fearful of conducting unethical experiments because if they do well they would be spared?

I think your stance on ethics is too utilitarian. By pardoning some of the most heinous acts performed by man, aren't you greatly undermining all your principles of justice and of law? I think you would also sanction killing a billionaire, because the suffering caused to him and his family is hugely outweighed by the millions of disadvantaged people that money would help.

In the original reports, only trace amounts of radiation were observed, exactly what they would've been exposed to with the equipment they were using. It was only in later reports that it became exaggerated. Read the Wiki, it's all right there.

[–]McGravin 2 points 4 years ago* 
When they came back for those they left behind, all but 1 of them were gone, and evidence suggests the last guy ate the others, despite not needing to for survival's sake.

Lewis Keseberg was the final survivor to be rescued. George Donner, Tamsen Donner, and Levinah Murphy had been the other three who couldn't be evacuated by the previous rescue party, but as far as I know all three bodies were present and there was no evidence that Keseberg ate any part of them (edit: all three had been partly cannibalized, although there is no evidence that Keseberg had murdered any of them). He did admit to eating William Eddy's son, as well as to taking some of the Donners' belongings and money. He was accused of murdering Tamsen Donner but was later absolved by historians and by Tamsen's daughter Eliza.

Earlier in the trip, Keseberg had been rather coldblooded, suggesting they hang one man for his crimes, and later forcing an old man to walk instead of ride in his wagon. Keseberg may be the most villainous member of the Donner party, but he's not quite as creepy as you make him out to be.

[–]himself_v 2 points 4 years ago 
Sure. It basically says bodies had more or less normal level of radiation, clothes samples had somewhat elevated levels of beta-particle radiation which was probably in a form of a contaminated dust or substance because it diminished with thorough washing.

"Could this level of radiation have been present without contact with radioactive substances or environments?" "Not really" On the other hand, they use the word "somewhat elevated" or even "slightly elevated", although later say that their work protocols in the lab require, for example, that even contaminated items have lower levels before washing. So as I get it, their conclusion is "clearly not normal levels, but still just somewhat elevated". There are tables with exact values so if you understand radiation levels you can see for yourself with google translate or something.

The radiation is still mentioned on the wikipedia page, along with other strange factors that create an air of mystery

[–]Micelight 2 points 4 years ago 
Let's be real here; when referencing a proper scientific report, media never makes the final cut. It's unreliable, subject to interpretation by people who don't know what they're talking about, and liable to sensationalism.

The article referenced by wikipedia cites a media report - which in turn cites no reports by independent or even government bodies. Essentially, the radiation claim is bullshit without proper documentation, which is lacking, making an avalanche the most possible scenario.

Himself_v posted this source multiple times.

And put this explanation if you can't read Russian: "Sure. It basically says bodies had more or less normal level of radiation, clothes samples had somewhat elevated levels of beta-particle radiation which was probably in a form of a contaminated dust or substance because it diminished with thorough washing. "Could this level of radiation have been present without contact with radioactive substances or environments?" "Not really" On the other hand, they use the word "somewhat elevated" or even "slightly elevated", although later say that their work protocols in the lab require, for example, that even contaminated items have lower levels before washing. So as I get it, their conclusion is "clearly not normal levels, but still just somewhat elevated".

Wanna know a secret? About 40% of straight men are slightly bi. (So say the results of penile plethysmography.)

I've heard it theorized that homophobia exists in our culture (and other cultures around the world) not to punish gay men, but to reinforce heterosexuality in those 40% of straight men.

You wrote off an entire indigenous people as cannibals, that's offensive, I'm not even Maori, but I find the fact that your summation of an entire people as 'NZ cannibals' is somewhat offensive, when only a small percentage of Maori tribes were cannibalistic, and even then no more than any other pacific group of people.

This "mystery" always appears but there never was any mystery at all. They carved the name of the island they were going to in a nearby tree. They were left for years without any support, couldn't cut it, and went to join the native tribe. When their support party finally came, there was a storm coming in. They arrived where the colony was supposed to be, saw Croaton carved into the tree trunk, realized the people of Roanoke had left to join the Croaton people, and decided that instead of continuing further in an oncoming storm to just turn around and go home. The "native" people of the area had blue eyes, blond hair, and lighter skin in the coming generations, so it was pretty obvious assimilation had occurred.

Had to be assimilation, because they left the crown to begin a new life in the new world for a reason: religious freedom. Being the first ever permanent colony they likely were approached by the locals without caution. Once learning the culture of the natives, they deemed it better than the one they already knew. I mean makes sense really... peoples main purpose to coming to Americas was for freedom, and they chose to never be apart of the crown again - best way to do it: disappear.

I don't understand why this is touted as such a huge mystery. The colonists were left without supplies. They abandoned their colony, leaving behind a mysterious message - "Croatan," which suddenly becomes much less mysterious when you realize that that was the name of a nearby island. Which later mysteriously became inhabited by mixed-race Indians.
