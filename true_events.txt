The story of [Delphine LaLaurie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphine_LaLaurie) is still one of the most horrifying and unnerving things that comes to mind when we're talking about shit that actually happened. 

She was a socialite in Louisiana who tortured and maimed her slaves. One day a house fire was started by one of her slave cooks who she had chained to a stove. The slave later said she started the fire as a way to kill herself. When police entered the house following the fire, they found slaves who were maimed due to all kinds of fucked up experiments LaLaurie had been doing on them. People had their limbs removed and re-attached and stuff like that. Reportedly, some of them even begged to be killed.

She was never caught.

> Prisoners of war were subjected to vivisection without anesthesia.[15] Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Scientists performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results.[16] The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.[17]

The most fucked up thing about this is that most of them were granted immunity in exchange for their experiment data, concerning germ warfare and some other things.

> The twin sisters were inseparable and had speech impediments that made it difficult for people outside their immediate family to understand them. As a result, they mixed very little with other children and were ostracized at school. This proved traumatic for the twins, eventually causing their school administrators to dismiss them early each day so that they might avoid bullying. Their language became even more idiosyncratic at this time. Soon it was unintelligible to others. 

>The girls had a long agreement that if one died, the other must begin to speak and live a normal life. During their stay in the hospital, they began to believe that it was necessary for one twin to die, and after much discussion, Jennifer agreed to be the sacrifice. In March 1993, the twins were transferred from Broadmoor to the more open Caswell Clinic in Bridgend, Wales; on arrival Jennifer could not be roused. She was taken to the hospital where she died soon after of acute myocarditis, a sudden inflammation of the heart. There was no evidence of drugs or poison in her system, and her death remains a mystery. On a visit a few days later, Wallace recounted that June "was in a strange mood. She said, 'I'm free at last, liberated, and at last Jennifer has given up her life for me.'"

I think I've mentioned this in a similar thread in the past, but I'm going to go with the Bath School disaster. It happened in Michigan in 1927, and to this day it's still the deadliest mass killing in an American school.

The story starts with a 54-year-old farmer named Andrew Kehoe. Kehoe was by all accounts a frugal (some would say stingy) man, and even though he wasn't well-liked by his neighbors, his reputation for thrift allowed him to be elected as treasurer of the Bath County school board, and for a brief time as the township's clerk as well. He lost a 1926 election for the clerk position, however, after running on a campaign that emphasized low property taxes, and at that point he seems to have decided that he would perform an act of revenge against the citizens who had made it possible for the government to take away his hard-earned money.

Starting that August, he gradually purchased several hundred pounds of both dynamite and a military surplus explosive called pyrotol, buying small quantities at numerous stores in the surrounding area in order to avoid suspicion. Under the guise of performing electrical work for the school district, he concealed these explosives inside the brick schoolhouse that held all of the district's children. His preparations were so involved that he entirely stopped working on his farm, and paying his mortgage. That December, he also purchased a rifle.

In May of 1927, Kehoe put his plan into action. He killed his wife, who was terminally ill with tuberculosis and had just been discharged from the hospital, and concealed her body inside a wheelbarrow in his farm's chicken coop, then surrounded it with all of his money and other earthly valuables, in order that they could be destroyed together. He then set about systematically sabotaging everything on his farm: cutting the wire on all his fences to render it unusable, killing the trees that shaded it, slicing through all of his grape vines at the root and then wiring the stems back into place so that nothing would seem amiss to a casual observer, and placing massive firebombs inside every structure on the farm. He also used wire restraints to hobble the legs of his two horses inside his barn, to prevent them from escaping from it once the bombs went off, and filled his truck with large quantities of explosives and metal shrapnel. Finally, he started a fire inside his home, and when the volunteer fire brigade arrived, he rode off and told them that they should leave, as they were his friends and they would soon be needed at the school.

At 8:45 that morning, fifteen minutes after the start of classes, an alarm clock that Kehoe had rigged as a detonator triggered the explosives he had concealed inside the north wing of the schoolhouse. A similar device in the south wing failed to activate, but the result of the one successful explosion was more than bad enough. In an instant, the entire north wing of the schoolhouse lifted several feet into the air, and community members miles away were jostled by the shockwave. Burning children were thrown through the windows of their classrooms, and the roof collapsed on top of those still inside. A local resident named Monte Ellsworth who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter described it thus: "There was a pile of children of about five or six under the roof and some of them had arms sticking out, some had legs, and some just their heads sticking out. They were unrecognizable because they were covered with dust, plaster, and blood. There were not enough of us to move the roof."

The efforts of more than a hundred frantic men were not enough to lift the roof off of the children, so Ellsworth volunteered to go home to his farm and get a thick rope that could be used to drag it off of them. On his way there, he passed his neighbor Kehoe on road. Kehoe favored him with a big smile and a cheerful wave.

When Kehoe arrived at the scene, he beckoned the school superintendent (whom he hated) over to his carriage. Witnesses saw the two struggling over Kehoe's gun, and then Kehoe fired a shot that triggered the bomb inside his carriage, spraying shrapnel into the crowd of rescuers and instantly killing both himself and his rival.

Eventually, the townspeople were able to clear enough of the wreckage to remove and treat all of the children who were still alive. They also discovered the second timer, and *the more than 500 pounds of explosives* that it was meant to detonate. You can see a picture of them [here](http://i.imgur.com/9zFP8NE.jpg).

In total, Kehoe killed 43 people that day: his wife, the superintendent, four bystanders who were too close to the truck bomb (including an eight-year-old boy who had escaped from the first explosion), and 38 people who had been inside the school, all but two of whom were children between the ages of seven and fourteen. 58 others were seriously injured. Kehoe's body was claimed by his sister, and secretly buried in an unmarked grave. The only explanation he left behind was a sign wired to a fence post at his farm - it read, "Criminals are made, not born."

Whenever I think about the Bath School disaster, I'm always taken aback by Kehoe's behavior. It's one thing to just snap in anger - while that's terrible, it's at least something you can understand on one level or another. But for more than half a year, Kehoe lived among these people, made small talk with them, and tipped his hat in the street, knowing that soon he would do his best to take all their children from them in one terrible morning of blood and fire. And as if that weren't enough, the sheer spite on display in every detail of his actions is just breathtaking. He went well out of his way to ensure that nothing he left behind would be of any use to anyone from that point forward. The horses didn't tax his land, but because someone might ride them after he was gone, they had to die. The vines didn't hurt his pride, but because they might nourish someone after he was gone, they had to die. He methodically sowed everything in his life with salt, and even his own death ensured that the survivors would gain no understanding or closure from his passing.

Surprised not to see this here already:

A man named Richard Parker is a character in a book:

>In 1838, Poe's only novel was published - The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Partway through the book, the crew of a ship called Grampus finds themselves with a busted boat and no food or water. They manage to catch a tortoise and strip off its shell, but eventually, in order to survive, the crew draws straws to figure out which of them will be sacrificed to provide meat for everyone else. The death straw goes to a former mutineer named Richard Parker, who is promptly stabbed to death; his head, hands and feet thrown overboard (you can read the whole grisly thing here). This keeps the floating Donner Party alive a little bit longer, but the two remaining crew members are still on the brink of death when they're finally rescued. 
    
    
40 years later, this happens:

....
    
>In 1884, a yacht named the Mignonette left England, headed toward Sydney, Australia.

>The yacht wasn't really made for trips around the world, so it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone when it sank in a storm. The four-man crew barely escaped in a lifeboat, but they definitely didn't have enough provisions for survival. They did catch a turtle and eat it, but just like their counterparts in the 45-year-old Poe tale, they needed more if they were going to be found alive when a rescue boat found them.

>One man - a 17-year-old named **Richard Parker** - fell overboard and then made the mistake of drinking seawater to attempt to quench his thirst. Parker started going downhill fast, and that's when his fellow survivors decided they would kill him to ensure their own survival. The men had considered drawing straws, but they figured Parker was so far gone they might as well kill him and drink his blood while it was fresh (instead of risking the contaminated blood that might occur if they just waited for him to die due to illness). After stabbing Parker in the throat with a penknife, the three men devoured him. They were rescued a few days later.

The story of Grigori Rasputin and the circumstances of his death.

It goes roughly like this. Rasputin was a very large man standing 6' 4" (1.93 m) and was a sort of adviser to the royal Romanav family of Russia. He repeatedly healed their fragile hemophiliac son, or so it is reported. He never really belonged to any specific sect per se, but was said to be a holy man. Many rumored him to be an agent of the devil or some possessed being. Pictures of the dude are creepy. 

Anyway, among political strife and rumors that Rasputin was seeking more power he was ordered to be killed. He was given a nice meal laced with enough poison to kill several men. After a while with no reaction they promptly shot him in the back. Rasputin fell, but regained his strength and attacked his assailants. He was shot again in the head, and beaten vigorously. They then wrapped him up and threw him in the Niva river. Later it was discovered that Rasputin had attempted to claw out of the ice and finally drowned.

This guy, rumored to have supernatural powers along being very large and creepy, survived thorough poisoning, shots to the back and head, beaten and thrown in the river, and finally drowned under the ice.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. It should be mentioned that historians are not 100% sure how it happened and most agree that some of it simply isn't true.

The brazen bull was a torture and execution device that basically roasted the person alive. It was a hollow brass bull with a door on the side. The victim would be locked inside. A fire was lit underneath the bull and a special design of tubes caused the steam to imitate the bellowing of a bull.


Legend has it (with some fairly convincing evidence) that the designer of the bull was locked inside to see if his creation was true to the description.

Overnight at the Battle of Shiloh, April 6 1862. Pittsburgh Landing, Tennessee. The battle to control a pivotal portion of the Mississippi River had been going all day and the fighting had been vicious and relentless. As night fell, hostilities died down. Before long a storm came along that brought a torrential downpour and lightning. 

The primary sources--letters, journals, etc--that came from that night all tell a similar story: as rain poured down, lightning strikes came from the sky around midnight to light up the battlefield. The effect was to momentarily lift the darkness and let the tired soldiers see the mutilated bodies of their fallen comrades all around them. Missing limbs, parts of their skulls, lying dead or occasionally half-dead in puddles and elsewhere. Additionally there are multiple sources talking about hogs feeding on the bodies at night, a number of which were not even dead  yet. 

The moaning and wailing of soldiers taking their last breaths lying on a bloody battlefield in darkness as rain pours down and lightning flashes around them is something that has always stuck with me. And to think the soldiers that made it through day one knew that at the first hint of daybreak they'd be firing and be fired upon once again is just chilling.

[Hinterkaifeck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinterkaifeck)

> Hinterkaifeck, a small farmstead situated between the Bavarian towns of Ingolstadt and Schrobenhausen (approximately 70 km north of Munich), was the scene of one of the most puzzling crimes in German history. On the evening of March 31, 1922, the six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a mattock. The murder is still unsolved.

> A few days prior to the crime, farmer Andreas Gruber told neighbours about discovering footprints in the snow leading from the edge of the forest to the farm, but none leading back. He also spoke about hearing footsteps in the attic and finding an unfamiliar newspaper on the farm. Furthermore, the house keys went missing several days before the murders, but none of this was reported to the police.

> Six months earlier, the previous maid had left the farm, claiming that it was haunted; the new maid, Maria Baumgartner, arrived on the farm on 31 March, only a few hours before her death.

> Exactly what happened on that Friday evening cannot be said for certain. It is believed that the older couple, as well as their daughter Viktoria and her daughter Cäzilia, were somehow all lured into the barn one by one, where they were killed. The perpetrator(s) then went into the house where they killed two-year-old Josef who was sleeping in his cot in his mother's bedroom, as well as the maid, Maria Baumgartner, in her bed-chamber.

>The police first suspected the motive to be robbery, and interrogated several inhabitants from the surrounding villages, as well as travelling craftsmen and vagrants. The robbery theory was, however, abandoned when a large amount of money was found in the house. It is believed that the perpetrator(s) remained at the farm for several days – someone had fed the cattle, and eaten food in the kitchen: the neighbours had also seen smoke from the chimney during the weekend – and anyone looking for money would have found it.

" Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosom's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb. "

The one serviceman who was rescued? That was George H. W. Bush.

Imagine how different the world would be if he hadn't survived.

Basically melting permafrost containing methane is thought to have caused runaway ocean toxicity and global warming, resulting in the Permian-Triassic extinction event 232 million years ago that wiped out the vast majority of life on Earth.

Shanti Devi was born in Delhi, India in 1926. From the age of 4, she claimed to remember details of a past life of a married woman in Maruthia named Lugdi Devi. She also remembered being married to a man named Kedar Nath and dying ten days after giving birth to a child.

Eventually, her headmaster found a merchant named Kedar Nath living 145km away in Maruthia who verified every single one of these details. Further investigation involving an independent commission from Mahatma Gandhi and later a number of sociologists, anthropologists and psychologists gave further evidence that she was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi. The commission eventually concluded that she was the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi.

She recognized any family member of Lugdi's that she met as Shanti and even recited a number of details such as promises Kedar failed to keep on Lugdi's deathbed, money stashed in a secret place and the layout of furniture in their marital home before she died.

So far, there has been no scientific explanation of this case and many scientists still dismiss it (and similar cases) as fraud.

I think the creepiest true event involves Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron, a Scottish-born psychiatrist who ended up working with the CIA.  Long story short, Cameron sat in judgment of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials.  Fast forward not even ten years and he's fast at work trying to wipe the minds of unsuspecting mental patients using electroshock therapy, LSD, sleep deprivation, and the relentless exposure of "patients" to continuous, meaningless audio tracks meant to "de-pattern" the human brain.  Oh, at at the same time he was Chairman of the World Psychiatric Association and President of the American and Canadian Psychiatric Associations.  

According to Wikipedia (which has a pretty good write up): 

Naomi Klein states in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron's research and his contribution to MKUltra were not about mind control and brainwashing, but "to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from 'resistant sources.' In other words, torture." She then cites Alfred W. McCoy: "Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Cameron's experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb's earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA's two-stage psychological torture method."

Both the Titanic and the Titan was 800 feet long, British-owned, and sank after hitting an iceberg in the north atlantic, in april, around midnight.

He writes that the Titan crashed into the iceberg at 25 knots, 400 miles from Newfoundland. The titanic crashed into the iceberg at 22,5 knots, 400 miles from Newfoundland.

Both had too few lifeboats to save all passengers, however, the Titan had 4 more than the Titanic.

WWI seemed to be destined to happen. Franz Ferdinand was in an open car parade through Sarajevo when a group of assassins planned to kill him. One of the assassins managed to throw a grenade but Franz's driver avoided it and blew up under the car behind them. The car sped away and the assassins dispersed. Ferdinand decided to go visit those injured in the bombing but his driver got lost and had to turn around. In doing so the car stalled, in front of a cafe, where one of the assassins was having a failure sandwich. He looked up, saw the archduke and his wife stuck in the car. He walked out, took out a pistol and shot them both dead. This moment of happenstance caused Central European powers to declare war on Serbia and what would become the allies of WWI

Edit: I understand WWI was going to happen anyways, that doesn't change the fact that this was strange as hell

[Elizabeth Bathory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory) - "After her husband Ferenc Nádasdy's death, she and four collaborators were accused of torturing and killing hundreds of girls, with one witness attributing to them over 650 victims, though the number for which they were convicted was 80.[4] Due to her rank, Elizabeth herself was neither tried nor convicted, but promptly imprisoned upon her arrest in December 1610 within Csejte Castle, Upper Hungary, now in Slovakia, where she remained immured in a set of rooms until her death four years later.

The case led to legendary accounts of the Countess bathing in the blood of virgins to retain her youth, and subsequently also to comparisons with Vlad III the Impaler of Wallachia, on whom the fictional Count Dracula is partly based, and to modern nicknames of The Blood Countess and Countess Dracula."

To me, all of the "the tinfoil hatters were right" reveals.
That there was indeed a shady backroom of powerful people doing LIBOR fixing; that the financial crisis was done willfully and knowingly(e.g. Goldman trading against their own clients, many other internal memos from various places involved revealing many knew about the level of toxicity etc); or even things like the takedown of the bank of england by Soros. 

Then all the reveals around "they really ARE watching our every move" NSA PRISM / full take capabilities, essentially rendering things like TOR dead.
The willingness of everyone do do the secret angecy's work for them via facebook by detailing their every move, social connection and meaningful event, like and dislike. "Total self-surveillance aids total state surveillance" I guess.

Basically almost everything you always thought was too nuts to be true only to find out it was and then some.

How about that time Russia might have almost [accidentally started nuclear war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident) and one guy prevented it because he didn't believe their early warning systems. 

>Shortly after midnight, the bunker's computers reported that one intercontinental ballistic missile was heading toward the Soviet Union from the U.S. Petrov considered the detection a computer error, since a first-strike nuclear attack by the United States was likely to involve hundreds of simultaneous missile launches in order to disable any Soviet means of a counterattack. Furthermore, the satellite system's reliability had been questioned in the past. Petrov dismissed the warning as a false alarm, though accounts of the event differ as to whether he notified his superiors or not after he concluded that the computer detections were false and that no missile had been launched. Later, the computers identified four additional missiles in the air, all directed towards the Soviet Union. Petrov again suspected that the computer system was malfunctioning, despite having no other source of information to confirm his suspicions. The Soviet Union's land radar was incapable of detecting missiles beyond the horizon, and waiting for it to positively identify the threat would limit the Soviet Union's response time to a few minutes.

Bonus nuclear creepy: the Russian [Dead Hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand_\(nuclear_war\)) system can launch a retaliatory nuclear strike in the event of a successful first strike destroying their leadership, with a network of sensors that listen for the signatures of nuclear attacks then launch communication rockets which tell everything else to just fire off all their nukes. It's still thought to be functional today but does have to be manually activated first, so it's good to know it probably won't be set off by a [meteor impact](http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-02s.html).

At the start of the Cold War, Henry Murray developed a personality profiling test to crack soviet spies with psychological warfare and select which US spies are ready to be sent out into the field. As part of Project MKUltra, he began experimenting on Harvard sophomores. He set one student as the control, after he proved to be a completely predictable conformist, and named him "Lawful".

Long story short, the latter half of the experiment involved having the student prepare an essay on his core beliefs as a person for a friendly debate. Instead, Murray had an aggressive interrogator come in and basically tear his beliefs to pieces, mocking everything he stood for, and systematically picking apart every line in the essay to see what it took to get him to react. But he didn't, it just broke him, made him into a mess of a person and left him having to pull his whole life back together again. He graduated, but then turned in his degree only a couple years later, and moved to the woods where he lived for decades.

In all that time, he kept writing his essay. And slowly, he became so sure of his beliefs, so convinced that they were right, that he thought that if the nation didn't read it, we would be irreparably lost as a society. So, he set out to make sure that everyone heard what he had to say, and sure enough, Lawful's "Industrial Society and its Future" has become one of the most well known essays written in the last century. In fact, you've probably read some of it. Although, you probably know it better as The Unabomber Manifesto.

Not sure if this counts as having some historical significance, but the Armin Meiwes story is creepy. 

Meiwes put up an internet post stated that he was "looking for a well-built 18- to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed". A man named  Brandes then answered the advertisement. As is known from a **videotape** the two made when they met on 9 March 2001 in Meiwes's home in the small town of Rotenburg, Meiwes amputated Brandes' penis and the two men attempted to eat the penis together before Brandes was killed. **Brandes had insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work** and ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes' penis. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw, but could not because it was too tough and, as he put it, "chewy". **Meiwes then fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic**; he then fried it with some of Brandes' fat but by then it was too burned to be consumed. He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog.[2]

According to journalists who saw the video, Brandes may already have been too weakened from the blood loss to eat any of his penis. Meiwes gave Brandes large quantities of alcohol and pain killers, twenty sleeping pills and a bottle of schnapps,[citation needed] kissed him and finally killed him in a room that he had built in his house for this purpose, the Slaughter Room. After stabbing Brandes to death in the throat, he hung the body on a meat hook and tore chunks of flesh from it. He tried to grind the bones to use as flour. **The whole scene was recorded on the two-hour video tape.** 

Meiwes ate the body over the next 10 months, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes and consuming up to 20 kilograms (44 lb) of the flesh. According to prosecutors, Meiwes committed the act for sexual enjoyment. Originally, Meiwes got off with manslaughter.

probably "The Bloop". sometime in the nineties, three ships detected a massive sound somewhere near the nemo point. the noise roughly a minute, when sped around up sixteen times, it sounds like a bubble rising to the surface of the ocean, hence "The Bloop". the frequency at which it was heard tends to be similar to those of animals, but it was several times louder than the loudest known animal, the blue whale, this either means that if an animal caused the bloop, it is a massive sized animal or it is very efficient at making noise. Another hypothesis for the noise is an ice-quake or an iceberg disintegrating. several other sounds have been heard much like this one but they were easily classified as non living entities such as icebergs running aground or scraping the floor

USS Indianapolis (CA-35) was a Portland-class heavy cruiser of the United States Navy. She was named for the city of Indianapolis, Indiana.

She served as flagship for Admiral Raymond Spruance while he commanded the Fifth Fleet in their battles across the Central Pacific. She holds a place in history due to the circumstances of her sinking, which led to the greatest single loss of life at sea in the history of the U.S. Navy. On 30 July 1945, shortly after delivering critical parts for the first atomic bomb to be used in combat to the United States air base at Tinian, the ship was torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine I-58, sinking in 12 minutes. Of 1,196 crewmen aboard, approximately 300 went down with the ship.

The remaining 900 men faced exposure, dehydration, saltwater poisoning, and shark attacks as they waited for assistance while floating with few lifeboats and almost no food or water. The Navy learned of the sinking when survivors were spotted four days later by the crew of a PV-1 Ventura on routine patrol. Only 317 sailors survived.[1]

Hitler became Hitler because he couldn't make a living as a painter. Dictator was plan B. 

Edit: Blame the "banality of evil," right? It's easy to forget Hitler in his 20s was just an average guy. ( And multiple dictators were just normal guys before the revolution.) He was a veteran of WW1, looking to make his way thru life--he wasn't a lifetime soldier or a child of a dictator. WW2 would've been different if PEOPLE HAD BOUGHT HIS LANDSCAPES. (Go back in time with some gold, give it to Hitler and tell him to "keep up the painting." Now there's a butterfly effect event!)

During WW2 the Japanese set up Unit 731.  They were involved in research and made many discoveries.  Did you know that if you cut an alive person open without painkillers and rip out their guts they'll die?  We know that now thanks to Unit 731.

They developed such wonderful inventions such as the plague bomb which was a bomb that was full of plague infected fleas.  They dropped them all over the place in China, killing countless people.

They tested diseases and medical procedures on Chinese civilians and Allied POWs.

After the war the US prosecuted them.  

Just kidding!  They were offered jobs and pardons by the US government.

In 1918, there was a battle between the British and the Germans near the village of Marcoing in France. The Germans were retreating and a British soldier with the name Henry Tandey spotted a wounded German soldier. He could've shot him and killed him, but he decided to spare his life. The German soldier thanked him and disppeared. The German soldier would later become who we know as **Adolf Hitler**

Here's a painting depicting the scene where Tandey spares Hitler: http://symonsez.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/hitler_5.jpg 
 The man carrying a wounded soldier on his back is Tandey, and of course, the man being carried is Hitler

In 1961, a B-52 carrying two nuclear bombs disintegrated over Goldsboro, NC. They were 2 and 2.5 megatons respectively, and one of them very nearly detonated according to recently declassified documents.

“As far as I’m concerned we came damn close to having a Bay of North Carolina. The nuclear explosion would have completely changed the Eastern seaboard if it had gone off.” - Lt. Jack Revelle

Swedish twin sisters (born 1967) who came to national attention in the United Kingdom in May 2008 after an apparent episode of folie à deux (or "shared psychosis"), a rare psychiatric disorder in which delusional beliefs are transmitted from one individual to another, which resulted in a series of bizarre incidents on the M6 motorway and the subsequent murder of Glenn Hollinshead of Fenton, Staffordshire. There was no evidence that drugs or alcohol were involved in the incidents on the M6 or the death of Hollinshead.

It may be because my graduate research involves handling some uranium but lately I've been creeped out by the [Goiânia accident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia_accident) that happened in Brazil in '87. So basically, the guy in charge of security of an radiotherapy center was playing hooky to go watch [Herbie Goes Bananas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqym9tvGEFs) with his family. Because of some legal dispute, an instrument with a radioactive Cs-137 source was left behind (hence the guard for an abandoned building). So while Herbie and Pacco are going bananas, two thieves break in and steal the instrument thinking they could break it up and sell the scraps. The same day they start taking this thing apart, both guys start puking and diarrhea-ing their guts out. Both end up getting limbs amputated because of the symptoms of their exposure but the cause is misdiagnosed. So these guys get the source out of the instrument and crack it open to see this [blue light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation). 

The thieves end up selling all this scrap to a junkyard who's owner, thinking the blue light was supernatural or something really valuable, brings it into his home and tries to fully break out all of this bright blue powder with the help of family and friends. So they proceeded to spill radioactive Cs-137 all over his home and hand it out as gifts to friends and family so they can enjoy the glowing-magic-rice from hell too. When everyone started getting sick the junkyard owners wife brings some of this stuff in a plastic bag by bus to a local hospital where luckily a visiting PhD confirmed its radioactivity. The wife, niece, and two employees of the junkyard owner died (he died later from [cirrhosis](http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/alcohol/). 

Tons of people were exposed. Some people came in with the stuff still on their skin. Makes my stomach turn just thinking about it. The shit that could kill you and uoeno it.

There's the Glico Morinaga case. An individual or group calling itself "The Monster with 21 Faces" started blackmailing a candy company in Japan, threatening to put poison-laced candy on store shelves if they didn't receive a ransom. Later, they switched to a different company but kept up the same tactics. At one point, an investigator dressed as a company employee went to make a money drop, following the Monster's instructions, and was watched by a suspicious looking man with "eyes like a fox". This Fox-Eyed Man was the main suspect in the case until leads went cold after the lead investigator committed suicide by self-immolation.

> Unable to capture the suspect believed to be the mastermind behind The Monster with 21 Faces, the police superintendent Yamamoto of Shiga Prefecture committed suicide by self-immolation in August 1985. Five days after this event, on August 12, "The Monster” sent its final message to the media:
> > "Yamamoto of Shiga Prefecture Police died. How stupid of him! We've got no friends or secret hiding place in Shiga. It's Yoshino or Shikata who should have died. What have they been doing for as long as one year and five months? Don't let bad guys like us get away with it. There are many more fools who want to copy us. No-career Yamamoto died like a man. So we decided to give our condolence. We decided to forget about torturing food-making companies. If anyone blackmails any of the food-making companies, it's not us but someone copying us. We are bad guys. That means we've got more to do other than bullying companies. It's fun to lead a bad man's life. Monster with 21 Faces."

The prison ships during the American Revolution.

Basically, the British ran out of room in their prisons so they started using decommissioned ships to hold the American POWs. Long story short, variety of factors led to horrendous conditions on board and prisoners had about a 50/50 chance of coming out alive.

There are reports of having to approach the fleet from upwind because you could smell the stench for miles. Bodies were buried right next to the ships on the beach, meaning that for decades after the war, any good storm would turn up thousands of bones. It wasn't until... 50 years later, IIRC, that a memorial was constructed and the bones were collected.

There are sources that say more people died in the prison ships than British soldiers on the battlefield during the entire war.

On my phone, otherwise I would get some sources. I wrote my thesis on the subject a.couple years ago. If anyone's interested, Googling the prison ship Jersey should get some good results.

The abuse by her father resulted in the birth of seven children and one miscarriage; four of the children joined their mother in captivity, and three were raised by Josef and Rosemarie Fritzl and reported as foundlings.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case)

The Menai Straits is the stretch of water between northwest Wales and the island of Anglesey. A ferry operated until a bridge was built in the early 19th century.

The ferry sank in 1664, 1785 and 1820. Each time there was only one survivor of the tragedy. Each time, the survivor was called Hugh Williams.

seriously though, this is weird. a young native american man's family is slaughtered at the battle of Tippecanoe so he puts a curse on the presidents of the united states, saying that any president that is elected in a year ending with a zero will die in office. the freaky thing is, the curse worked. William Henry Harrison, abraham Licoln, James Garfield, William McKinley, Warren G. Harding, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy ALL were elected in years that ended with zero and ALL died in office. i hear that ronald reagan's wife knew about the curse and did a seiance in the white house. reagan was elected in a year that ended with a zero and was shot during an assassination attempt but he survived. that is freaky deaky.

The [Tuskegee syphilis experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment) makes my skin crawl.

African-American men were screened for syphilis in 1932 and 399 were identified as having the disease.  They were followed-up by physicians for 40 years in order to observe the natural history of what happens when people are infected with syphilis.

The subjects were not told they had syphilis.  When penicillin became widely available in 1947, the study physicians did not give it to the subjects; and, what is worse, they actively prevented the subjects from receiving treatment elsewhere.

Medical ethics were not unheard of in 1932; the people who conducted this study simply felt free to violate them.  On the positive side, this story is taught to medical researchers today and nowadays all medical research is reviewed by Institutional Review Boards to ensure subjects are treated ethically.

The whole idea of origins of Christianity and its symbols is pretty creepy. So your religious leader is tortured and painfully killed on the common execution device of the time. Out of the writings about his live forms a religious believe about forgiveness, peace, doing good, etc. So far so good. Now, instead of using a symbol that is connected to the live of your religious leader (e.g. a carpenter’s tool) this torture and execution device becomes the predominant symbol and it is put on everything: your temples, your books, people wear it as an amulet around there neck. So every time you pray as a Christian to a cross you are actually addressing a torture and execution device. 
I do not write that with an atheist agenda. Being a Christian myself the thought creeps me out.

[The Babushka Lady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babushka_Lady) is considered to be an integral clue to the assassination of JFK. Conspiracy theories aside, it is very possible that she is the one person who can single-handedly prove or disprove many of the theories, as she is believed to have perfect photographic evidence of the assassination.  
You can [see her (highlighted in color)](http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/2/4/5/69245_v1.jpg) in this photo and she seems to be quite young, despite being presumed as an old lady.  
It has been pointed out by many that she performs some subtle bodily actions that seem to be relative to the happening incident. 
Despite huge media attention and officials asking her to come forward, her identity is still unknown.  
**REQUEST** - If you find [this kind of camera and/or reel,](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS9zyEvYK07bg_yyPpCPLG1LLAckris8fjcA2g6-13bQPRrUNFm) It might just be the tape that can solve a 50 year old murder.

In WWI, an English soldier named Edward Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. Instead of shooting the soldier, he took pity on him and saved his life. 

The man ended up being Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler even acknowledged it.

The Dyatlov pass incident. I think a dozen students were brutally killed in a snowstorm on a skiing trip one night, most of them in various states of undress. There were no footprints but those belonging to the students, the force required to crush their skulls and cause the other injuries was that of a car crash, and one of the girl's had her tongue ripped out. The other circumstances around it were insane and creepy (they found higher than normal radiation levels on the students, their tent was ripped apart from the inside, two of the students had ripped their hands into a bloody pulp trying to climb a tree... oh, they were both in their underwear in -5 C weather). Nobody to this day is sure of what happened.

A lecturer at my university was quite adamant that Ivan Pavlov experimented on not only dogs,  but children too. I can't seem to find any sources besides the lecturer though. 

Still, the way he experimented on those dogs is pretty nasty all by itself. 


**Edit:** I found a [video]( http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/dark-matters-twisted-but-true/videos/orphans-trained-to-mindlessly-obey.htm)  attributing the child experiments to Nikolai Krasnogorsky, but Pavlov does make a brief appearance.

After the final Jack the Ripper murder (which was hugely horrible and creepy in its own right) they thought that they could get an image of a killer by taking a photo of the retinas of the unfortunate victim. The idea what the last images you saw would be burned into the retina. Of course it didn't work, but they were desparate at that point to catch the killer. The significance is perhaps such a cime would have been solved before it got that far as there was an abundance of forensic materials but no means/understanding of getting the data from it e.g. Fingerprinting had been invented but was not in common use. There was no test to know if a blood stain was even human, let alone DNA... It was one of the last major crimes when the police only really had luck as the main tool to catch the killer....

Maybe not the creepiest, but upon being rescued, the remnant of the crew of the sunken [*Essex*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_%28whaleship%29#Chase_boat) were found chewing the bones of their former mates, and were so dissociative they did not realized they were being rescued, even as their rescuers pulled up alongside them.

The Martyrdom of the Báb - July 9, 1850
http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=30

The Bab along with 1 other person was scheduled to be executed by a firing squad of 750 soldiers in front of 10k witnesses. After all 750 soldiers fired and when the smoke had cleared it was discovered the Bab had vanished, not a single bullet had struck Him or His companion but had cut the ropes that had bound His hands. The Bab had warned the guards that that day was not to be the day of His death.. He was later found in His cell finishing a conversation He had been having with a fellow prisoner the night before. Another 750 man firing squad had to be formed and it was only after the second attempt that the Shah's orders were finally carried out.

This is the modern day equivalent of the Crucifixion of Christ and hardly anyone even noticed it. The events of the story were witnessed by thousands and recorded in various forms of literature so zero speculation is needed.

The story of how Josef Mengele supposedly hid out in a town in Brazil and was responsible for the ridiculously high birthrate of twins there (as many as 1 in 5 pregnancies resulted in twins; global average is around 1 in 80).

From the article:
"The people of Candido Godoi now largely accept that a Nazi war criminal was an inadvertent guest of theirs for several years in the early 1960s. The town's official crest shows two identical profiles and a road sign welcomes visitors to a "Farming Community and Land of the Twins". There is also a museum, the House of the Twins."

The Philadelphia Experiment & Project Rainbow.

Supposed electro-magnetic cloaking technology experiment, which was carried out on the US Navy destroyer USS Eldridge back in 1943. The ship was reported missing (or cloaked) for a period of time during the experiment. Upon returning, some of the crew were missing, some were reported to be fused into the super-structure of the ship, others were reported to have spontaneously combusted, some had fallen mentally insane. A major cover up by the government was reported, and the experiment has since been completely denied and falsified.  Scary stuff.

This wasn’t just because of the gruesome nature of the case, but also because the case was so incredibly weird, and it remains unsolved to this day."

The Dyatlov Pass Incident

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident

> The Dyatlov Pass incident refers to the mysterious deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. 

Under really, *really* mysterious circumstances.

* Although the temperature was very low, around −25 to −30 °C, the dead were only partially dressed. 

* Some were found wrapped in snips of ripped clothes that seemed to have been cut from those who were already dead.

* There were no indications of other people nearby

* The tent had been ripped open from within

* Traces from the camp showed that all group members left the camp of their own accord, on foot.

* **Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny stated that the fatal injuries of the three bodies could not have been caused by another human being**

* Forensic radiation tests had shown **high doses of radioactive contamination** on the clothes of a few victims

* The final verdict was that the group members all died because of a "compelling natural force".

The Death of Rasputin has amazed people since Dec. 16, 1916.  

He was considered to be a kind of unofficial "monk" in the Russian Church, but he was also notorious for his sexual escapades.  These were made possible by his power over the Empress--he was the only one who could stop her hemophiliac son from bleeding to death.  In addition to political power, this ability made Rasputin seem supernatural.  

A certain Prince Yusupov--a notorious bisexual--invited him to dinner on December 16, 1916.  With one or two helpers standing by, Yuspov fed Rasputin cyanide.  This failed to kill him.  Starting to panic, the assassins pulled-out a pistol and shot him several times.  Then they put his body into a cloth sack and dumped Rasputin into the river.  A few days later, the "mad monk" washed-up on the river bank.  The coroner returned a verdict of death by drowning!  To his enemies, the gruesome end of Rasputin confirmed his status as a demon from hell.

I don't know if this is further down since I stopped reading on account of the horrifying action the comments describe, but one atrocity I always found fucked up was the rape of Nanjing (Nanking). The most fucked up part is the Japanese refuse to acknowledge it ever happened, Germany at least acknowledged the Holocaust and the US acknowledge that it fucked up with putting the Japanese in internment camps but Japan refuses to acknowledge it and former Japanese soldiers who have come forth have been dishonorably discharged or slandered by the Japanese government.

Hitler was allegedly wounded in World War 1 and a British soldier decided to spare his life. Imagine how much different things would have been if he didn't.

[Elizabeth Báthory, AKA The Countess of Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory), a 16th century Hungarian noblewoman, and believed to be the most prolific female serial killer in history, she lured peasant girls to her castle before torturing, mutilating and eventually murdering them. She was eventually convicted of 80 counts of murder, but her total number of victims is estimated to be as high as 650. Thought to be the inspiration for the Brides of Dracula, popular legend states that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her beauty.

Gilles de Rais. He's famous for supporting Joan of Arc during the Hundred Years War (one of few). He fought by her side and was killed in a similar way to Joan of Arc, except for one massively different reason. It was found out that de Rais was kidnapping and killing boys between the ages of 6-18. People speculated that he tortured and killed between 80 and (wait for it) 800 kids before it was discovered and he was executed

The "Dyatlov Pass" incident by far the creepiest thing that's ever happened to humans on this planet in our time here on earth that we KNOW of or of course, in this case, do NOT know of...  My god this story FREAKS. ME. OUT. 

If you do not know what this is I urge you to proceed with caution as I have wracked my brain for many years now on this subject and its events and am still completely bewildered and still as completely freaked out as the first time I read about it. Unless you're ready for some crazy ass shit...  Steer clear my friends...

Possibility of being fake, but the "alien encounters" from the town from "The fourth kind" in Alaska.
Apparently 300 people showed the same psychological symptoms, and like 8 people describes the same exact nightmare/encounters with their psychiatrist, and the missing girl. and then all the footage(which may be fake)
If it is all true, what is the explanation? 
The coincidences alone are enough for me to fully believe in Aliens if their true.

Surprised nobody has mentioned the dyatlov pass incident yet, I'm heading to my computer to get links now but the book Dead Mountain does a great job explaining it.

In a nutshell a group of extremely seasoned hikers set out for a Siberian peak, they're found weeks later, the tent cut open from the inside, radiation on their clothes, blunt force trauma killed some. Others were found close to a mile away from the tent with none of their warm hiking gear and their tongues removed. It's pretty darn creepy once you factor in the KGB questioning their families and appearing at all the funerals.

In 2000 a man named Peter Lundin, who had in 1991 as a 19-year old, killed his mother and been helped by his father to bury the body, had been suspected of killing his wife and two kids (nobody had seen them in a couple of weeks). The police found traces of blood, and axe marks in the house. Some time later they found out that he had snapped all three persons necks with his bare hands, chopped up their bodies with and axe and some power saw, put them in plastic bags and had put the bags out in the street for the garbage men to take.

He confessed but the police never found anything of the bodies.

Tropical Storm Zeta.  Freaky even to acknowledge that it happened.  Not only was it the second tropical cyclone in the North Atlantic to take place in two different years as it was formed on December 29, 2005 and dissipated on January 6, 2006, but it also was the 28th tropical cyclone of the Hurricane Season.  Hurricane Epsilon came in late November and ended in early-to-mid December, which led many to wonder what the heck was going on with the weather patterns and what freakish weather events were to come next.

Havent seen any of the Canadians post on here about residential schools...

True? Check.

Significant? Most definitely.

Basically the Canadian government and three mainline churches (still active today btw) perpetrated the mass genocide of tens of thousands of Aboriginals in Canada. How they did this was basically dividing and conquering the non-christian, nomadic Aboriginals and sending them to highly diseased, highly fucked up buildings (known as residential schools) with reports of up to 40% of them dying. Stories of mass graves specifically for girls impregnated by the priests via rape have been witnessed. Electric chairs where children were strapped to to please the church and Government inspectors. Children forced to eat their own vomit. Beatings, rape, murder, sexual exploitation. Children. 

Oh and the government has still not apologized for it. Will post more or source if anyone actually reads this...

I think what [Unit 731](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) did was horrifying, but then the U.S. Goverment dismissed what happened in exchange for the data collected...that's even more horrible!

"A special project code-named Maruta used human beings for experiments. Test subjects were gathered from the surrounding population and were sometimes referred to euphemistically as "logs" (丸太, maruta?) This term originated as a joke on the part of the staff because the official cover story for the facility given to the local authorities was that it was a lumber mill. In an account by a man who worked as a "junior uniformed civilian employee" of the Japanese Army in Unit 731, the term Maruta came from German, meaning medical experiment, used in such contexts as, "How many logs fell?""

On April 10, 2002 in Los Angeles, Antron Singleton, also known by his rap alias 'Big Lurch', was found naked, covered in blood and staring up at the sky by the police, high on PCP. During a subsequent medical examination, his stomach was pumped, and medical staff found human flesh that was not his. Upon a search of his apartment, police found his roommate Tynisha Ysais dead. She had had her chest ripped open, and a three inch knife blade broken off in her shoulder, with her lungs having been ripped out. The same tissue the medical staff found in Antron's stomach. He was sentenced to life in prison. He's nicknamed "the PCP cannibal" online and elsewhere.

Not going to link it, because for many it would be very upsetting, but there was a cult that poisoned themselves (the 'drinking the kool-aid' phrase comes from this).

They believed it that much... and killed their whole families.   There is an audio recording of the children slowly crying quieter and quieter. And then its quiet.

Define creepy how you want, but that happened.  Though I have a stance of "let people believe what they want", its a reminder of how far charisma and mental disorders can go if left unchecked.

Different sources name different numbers of victims. Fact is that it's a lot.

At the Drive-In wrote a song about it and the video also gives some interesting details to the story.

Jack The Ripper -  It is unclear just how many women the Ripper killed. It is generally accepted that he killed five, though some have written that he murdered only four while others say seven or more. The public, press, and even many junior police officers believed that the Ripper was responsible for nine slayings. The five that are generally accepted as the work of the Ripper are:

Mary Ann (Polly) - Nichols, murdered Friday, August 31, 1888.
- Annie Chapman, murdered Saturday, September 8, 1888.
- Elizabeth Stride, murdered Sunday, September 30, 1888.
- Catharine Eddowes, also murdered that same date.
- Mary Jane (Marie Jeanette) Kelly, murdered Friday, November 9, 1888.

Besides these five there are good reasons to believe that the first victim was really Martha Tabram who was murdered Tuesday, August 7, 1888, and there are important considerations for questioning whether Stride was a Ripper victim. As to the actual number of women that the Ripper killed, Philip Sugden wrote in his excellent book, The Complete History of Jack the Ripper, "There is no simple answer. In a sentence: at least four, probably six, just possibly eight."

All five of these listed plus Tabram were prostitutes and were killed between early August and early November 1888. All but Tabram and Kelly were killed outdoors and there is no evidence to suggest that any of them knew each other. They varied in both age and appearance. Most were drunk or thought to be drunk at the time they were killed.

Jaws (1975)

Hooper: You were on the Indianapolis? 

Brody: What happened? 

Quint: Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte... just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know, you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know. 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. 

So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks, maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. 

On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosom's mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist.

 Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He's a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin' for my turn. 

I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29, 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

I read a story about a boy who was being tortured on The Rack (basically where you are put on a plank and stretched out til your joints separate and sometimes limbs are yanked off).  Anyway, he was accused of some kind of heresy and was being stretched along with having a fire lit underneath him (they loved to combine forms of torture back in the day).  As he was being roasted, his arms were ripped off.  So much blood poured from his wounds that the fire was extinguished.

In **1884**, the yacht Mignonette sank. Four people survived and drifted in a life boat before one of them, the cabin boy **Richard Parker**, was killed by the others for food. This led to the [R v Dudley and Stephens criminal case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens).

In Edgar Allan Poe's only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, published in **1838**, Richard Parker is a mutinous sailor on the whaling ship Grampus. After the ship capsizes in a storm, he and three other survivors draw lots upon Parker's suggestion to kill one of them to sustain the others. **Richard Parker** then gets cannibalized.

"The Bloop" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloop

>Fox's hunch is that the sound nicknamed Bloop is the most likely to come from some sort of animal, because its signature is a rapid variation in frequency similar to that of sounds known to be made by marine beasts. There's one crucial difference, however: in 1997 Bloop was detected by sensors up to 4800 kilometres apart. That means it must be far louder than any whale noise, or any other animal noise for that matter. Is it even remotely possible that some creature bigger than any whale is lurking in the ocean depths? Or, perhaps more likely, something that is much more efficient at making sound?

Ed Gein - here's a vid: http://youtu.be/1qsA9NcJbqc

He's labeled as a serial killer but, I don't even know that he should really qualify because, he only killed two women. (Never thought I'd play down two murders before in my entire life.) Anyways, what made everything really creepy was what else he was doing. When the police went into his home they found body parts everywhere.

What really got creepy was that he was using these body parts as decorations. He had been grave robbing and taking these body parts from dead women and carving them into bowls or skinning them and using that flesh as upholstery for furniture. Stuff that was just really super bizarre and really creepy. 

There's a lot of horror movies that borrow from his original story, like Psycho and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. When they say the movie is based on a true story in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it's actually his story they're basing it off of.

One of the scariest things I ever saw as a kid was a museum tour in New Orleans. There was a setup of Delphine LaLaurie chasing a male slave. She had a really awful face and the slave looked so utterly terrified. I had so many nightmares about it... went on for years.

Actually, she was simply 'permitted to leave'.  She had maltreated *her livestock* and was within her rights.  Which is why slavery is so vile.  Her mother was murdered in a servile revolt, and she may have been seeking the matricides. Her husband was a doctor, and when doctors *go bad* they go **really bad**.  Total monster.

This strains credulity. removing and reattaching limbs is not something you can do without serious knowhow and training. Even trained doctors at the time weren't really able to do it, heck we STILL aren't that good at it.

Most, if not all of the stories are untrue or unfounded. I'll break it down in bullet points in reverse chronological order:

- The most ridiculous claims (like people being skinned alive or merged with animals) were made up by certain ghost tour companies. You can hang out around the house, watch the tours go by, and hear a different version depending on the guide. It's fairly common knowledge that certain tour companies make shit up.

- The only 'contemporary' account of the LaLauries was written by an abolitionist Brit, Harriet Martineau, who didn't show up in New Orleans until two years *after* the LaLauries disappeared. She was an obviously biased source in a time with lax journalistic standards. Besides that, fucking with tourists is a pastime in most cities (there's a reason why /r/neworleans has an Arby's logo and shoe in the header).   

- The abolitionist writer would naturally be looking for real or exaggerated horrors of slavery to bring back to England. LaLaurie was the perfect target: an established name, kind of a bitch, and out of the country. There's a reason the abolitionist writer didn't pick someone who was still living in the South: they would have fought back against what today would be called libel. Anyone who owned a significant number of slaves would also have money and influence. 

- The abolitionist writer claimed that LaLaurie used big spiked collars on her slaves. [They were fucking nasty things](http://usslave.blogspot.com/2011/02/iron-chains-and-collars-on-slaves.html) intended to prevent slaves from running away. The **real** horror here is that those collars were entirely legal in Louisiana during LaLaurie's time. In fact, if you removed the collar against the owner's wishes, you'd face a fine of up to $1,000 (in early 1800s dollars) and up to six months in jail.

This is not to say that slavery wasn't bad; slavery is a horrific thing. This is just to say that LaLaurie's actions (giving spiked collars, chaining slaves in the kitchen) were standard for the time and place. That's what scares me.

A lot of this is from my own research combing through the first book about the LaLauries, looking through history books about slavery, and living in New Orleans. The evidence has all been out there, but I don't think anyone's put it all together in this way before.

tl;dr Leave LaLaurie alone

Honestly you can't judge the Kennedy's on this.  This was just what doctors recommended you do to developmentally disabled kids with behavior problems at this time.  It does seem fucked up, and frankly it is, but you have to realize we did not have the kinds of psychological tools to deal with these types of behaviors at that time.  This was decades before Skinner and token economies.  This was a time when Freud's ideas were still given consideration.  

On a side note, this incident directly led to the founding of the Special Olympics, which is frankly an awesome organization.  I work with developmentally disabled people and you can't imagine the sense of pride some of my clients get from competing in the Special Olympics.  They freaking beam with pride.  I had one guy who wore his medals into work for like 2 months straight.  He came in every day Michael Phelpsed out like a boss.  The guy is awesome on so many levels.

Except she was not mentally handicapped.  She was a perfectly normal teen, just not as "perfect" as her highly successful brothers.  They say her mood swings were probably due to hormonal changes of puberty. 
This makes it all the more horrible.  The parents just didn't want to deal with a more rebellious child...

One of the doctors who performed this procedure on Ms. Kennedy, Dr. Walter Freeman, went on to perform transorbital lobotomies on 2,500 patients in 23 states.  

In 1952 he performed 228 transorbital lobotomies in a two-week period in my home state of West Virginia. Perhaps the most sinister part of this act, besides it simply happening, is that it was for a state-sponsored lobotomy project.

You do realize they performed 1000's of lobotomys during that same time period.  I'm curious as to why you picked Rose Kennedy specifically?  This same story applies to many, many people. 

I'd also tell you to take note that Rose's condition is what birthed the whole idea for the Special Olympics, so as horrifying as this story is, there is a bright spot in there somewhere.

I read the biography of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy last year. Based upon how high their standards were as a family I honestly wonder if Rosemary was *that* intellectually impaired. 

According to his mom, for example, JFK was a physically awkward book worm. This is the war hero who went on to be the youngest, sexiest POTUS that Americans had ever seen. 

Everything is relative, and with that many kids there has to be a high incidence of comparison and polarization.

Reminds me of [Issei Sagawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issei_Sagawa), a Japanese man who went to France and killed and ate a Dutch woman. He was sent to a mental institution in France instead of prison, and checked himself out shortly after, in 1986. He's been a free man ever since.

He had a brief stint doing cooking reviews or writing or something. Apparently these days he can't land a job anywhere and nobody will take him in.

The guy he ate was actually the second guy who responded to the ad. IIRC, another guy had answered the ad chickened out, so him and Armin Meiwes ended up ordering a pizza, getting some beers, and watching TV.

The worst thing about the story is that Meiwes genuinely seemed like a nice guy. One guy who he invited over, who had every intention of being eaten, backed out when it came down to it. And so what did Meiwes do? Did he go into a frenzy and kill him anyway? No. He invited him to the cinema. And they had a good time.

From Wikipedia:

"The ground floor of the Castle contained Holmes's own relocated drugstore and various shops, while the upper two floors contained his personal office and a maze of over 100 windowless rooms with doorways opening to brick walls, oddly-angled hallways, stairways to nowhere, doors openable only from the outside, and a host of other strange and labyrinthine constructions. Holmes repeatedly changed builders during the construction of the Castle, so only he fully understood the design of the house."

There is also a theory by a contemporary distant relative that he was Jack the Ripper too, having supposedly been in England during the time of the murders. How much of this is true I don't know. This guy wrote a book, Bloodstains, about all these horrific journals from Holmes. He will not state whether or not the journals are real (supposedly because them the government would be after them), yet he has worked with handwriting experts to compare them and the famous note from Jack the Ripper. It's all a bit odd, because he certainly acts like they are real, but when questioned point blank he won't say.

What's weird about it is that he wasn't caught until *after* the Chicago World's Fair. Holmes claimed to have killed dozens of people, but no one ever became suspicious enough to investigate.

And the reason he got caught was no because of the murders themselves, but because he was terrible about repaying debts.

If the book is to be believed about his personality, what makes Holmes so successful is that he wasn't some creepy guy in a van. This guy was handsome and an almost infallible charmer. There were many moments most men would've been caught, but Holmes was able to talk his way out of almost anything.

Have there been multiple people to have done this? I was in a home in Scotland that was set up exactly as his "murder castle" was described. The slanted hallways, stairs to nowhere, a door that was on a very high floor that led to nothing - you fall out of the building and die. I think it was the home of a woman obsessed with daisies. 

All the sink drains were 13 petal daisies. 

To google! (I may be meshing two different places together.) 

Edit: Nevermind. Found it. Winchester Mystery House. A woman built a house just like a death maze that only she knew the layout of, but instead of killing people, she used it to keep "evil spirits" from finding her.

I did a research paper on Mengele in high school.  What scared me the most wasn't his inhumanity, but his humanity.  One of the Sonderkommando with a medical background worked with Mengele doing autopsies.  He spoke with Mengele about wanting to know if his wife and child were still alive.  Mengele expressed regret in knowing that his colleague's family was in the camps, and gave him permission to look for them.  The sonderkommando found his wife and child alive, and told Mengele.  Mengele told the man that a train was coming for a camp that treated its prisoners well, as they were required for important factory work, and to tell the family to volunteer to go there.  Mengele did, his family obeyed, and if I remember correctly, they all lived through the war.  The fact that Mengele can mercilessly murder so many people but have compassion for this single Jewish family is honestly horrifying.  Even the worst of the Nazis were human beings that felt compassion, and despite their compassion, still committed these atrocities. 

[This is the book I read it in, I'm not sure if the doctor was a Sonderkommando or not, but he certainly feared for his life throughout the whole ordeal.](http://www.rakuten.com/prod/auschwitz/218182705.html?listingId=226083099&s_kwcid=)  An excellent read for anyone interested in this sort of thing.

This always makes me more angry of my country than a lot of other things. After the Germans lost and everything with the Holocaust was coming to light, we were justifiably stunned and disgusted and treated the Germans who were most responsible for orchestrating it accordingly. Then we discover this shit which is just as bad if not worse as anything the Germans did and we let it all go, simply because they killed a greater number of their prisoners with experimentation instead of Zyklon B and we wanted the data. It's a disgrace.

Japan employed [Unit 731](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) to develop powerful biological weapons, experimenting on prisoners. And they managed to do so by breeding rats infested with plague-infected fleas. 

Unit 731 also developed an innovative method to deliver small payloads to America, [Fire Balloons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_balloon), relying on the [Jet Stream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream) to fly across the ocean from Japan straight to America. They tested it and it worked, it resulted in a couple of deaths (some family at a picnic), and ~~was the only direct foreign attack on America in US history history (up until 9/11)~~. (Edit: Seems the war of 1812 disproved this)

Combine these two facts.   **The Japanese had almost perfected the ability to launch biological weapons on the United States**, and would have done so if they weren't forced into surrender. If the US had delayed any longer, they could have suffered catastrophic causalities on their own home soil. This fact blows my mind.

This contributed in part to the continued hostility between Asian nations and Japan.

In the west, the Nazis got their day in court. Those who could escape would die either from vigilante actions or alone and exiled forever.

But in the Eastern theater, show trials and exonerations and and politically motivated pardons were de riguere. And the longer we let this sit, the more evidence we'll lose to time and mortality, and the more obfuscation there will be - whether from Japanese apologists and war crime deniers, or from cynical autocratic dictatorships inflating past injustices to provide a convenient scapegoat.

In many ways, the Allies sowed the seeds of this continuing resentment by failing to administer justice for all. In the end, it was justice for Europe, makeshift middle-through for Asia. And this resentment will continue as long as politicians on both sides find it easier to point fingers and demonize, than to actually engage and compromise.

Thing that really gets me about Unit 731 is the fact America pardoned the culprits in order to obtain the data for personal use. I'm sure some of the scientists were even given American Citizenship for the work. Similarly all the Nazi War Criminals pardoned by American in order to gain there knowledge.

I mean, you're also leaving out the fact that the Japanese had recorded instances of cannibalizing prisoners (Flyboys, read it) and also using prisoners as live bayonetting practice (Hidden Horrors, another great read) as well as raping women, and when there weren't enough holes, guess what!! Those rascally Japanese made sure to create some extra room to accommodate everyone! (anything ever written on the Rape of Nanking)

Currently doing a thesis, partially on WWII POWs in the Pacific, researching how the Japanese treated people during and pre-WWII is quite the trip and not for the faint of heart, man.

Infants were not believed to feel pain in the medical community or at least for the first days up until fairly recently. In 1980's an open heart surgery was performed on a day-old infant without anasthesia- which died three days later- the mom sued the hospital claiming it was cruel and inhumane to perform surgery on any human without the relief of pain medication- don't have the source :-//

I'm ways curious about this on a purely practical level. Wouldn't surgery on an awake patient be harder? Even if you strap them down they still tense up, lock their muscles, and I'm sure the adrenaline and other hormones from the pain will screw up your vitals and other measurements. Why do it awake?

The thing that really blows my mind and causes a massive ethical dilemma is the fact that Unit 731 really raised the field of medical science, especially in regard to germ warfare. Much of that data is data that we refer to now because we are unwilling to run the same experiments. Moreover, much of the information we have about hypothermia also came from a german research camp similar to this. So much knowledge was gained, but at what cost?

"After Imperial Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945, Douglas MacArthur became the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupation. MacArthur secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare.[9] American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail.[32] The U.S. believed that the research data was valuable. The U.S. did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons.[33]"

> The most fucked up thing about this is that most of them were granted immunity in exchange for their experiment data, concerning germ warfare and some other things.

This is what I hate about these kinds of stories the most. As awful, deplorable, and disgusting as the acts are, the information gained from it is often useful. Part of me wants to say "at least those people didn't suffer completely in vain" but at the same time I don't want to condone it in any way. It's such a catch 22.

I think, and this is a guess, that Unit 731 was granted immunity so that their research didn't end up elsewhere.  I think we wanted the results, and only the USA was to get access to them.

> Unit 731. Heard of Josef Mengele

That always comes up in ethics classes.  They horrifically slaughtered thousands.  Yet the results of their work have been key in saving millions.  

Specifically, Mengele's work on [Hypothermia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation#Freezing_experiments). He killed roughly 100 people experimenting with with the intent of discovering means to prevent and treat hypothermia.  Now, that information is used regularly by medical professionals to know how to treat people with hypothermia.  Far more than 100 lives have been saved from that data.

It doesn't make it right.  But it does make you think.

I don't know why everyone feels like the US messed up by doing that. I highly doubt if the Japanese were to be sentenced to death (as they expected) they would willingly give up the information. When offered the choice of a pardon in exchange for the information they gave up the research.

That research has been proven valuable and at least in some weird way the people who were murdered and tortured didn't die for nothing (as if they were murdered and tortured and nothing came of it).

What's done was done and nothing the US or any other nation could have done was going to take back the damage and loss of human life.

>A medical school and research facility belonging to Unit 731 operated in the Shinjuku District of Tokyo during World War II. In 2006, Toyo Ishii—a nurse who worked at the school during the war—revealed that she had helped bury bodies and pieces of bodies on the school's grounds shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945. In response, in February 2011 the Ministry of Health began to excavate the site.[29]

>China requested DNA samples from any human remains discovered at the site. **The Japanese government—which has never officially acknowledged the existence of Unit 731**—rejected the request.[30]

Worth noting is the weaponry they developed, one of the key things the US was interested in when it gave them clemency. Their biological weapons included typhoid, dysentery, cholera, anthrax and bubonic plague. Their chemical weapons included mustard gas and chlorine gas.

Unit 731 made the mustard gas weapons the United States sold to Saddam Hussein, which he then used to genocide the Kurds of his country.

If you want more information there is a book about them called "The Silent Twins".  What is really crazy is that it does mention the fact that they vowed to live a normal life if one of them ever died.  While incarcerated they began to believe that one of them *must* die.

I don't think there's a complete lack of understanding in the case. It's totally twisted and fucked up, but he felt he had a message, and people will do crazy shit if they think their message is important enough.  
 
 "Criminals are made, not born" could have meant that the town brought this upon themselves, just solidifying Kehoe as a real greedy bastard. The other potential interpretation of the message is to have people acknowledge the presence of evil. Maybe he wanted something that people couldn't have closure or understanding of. Something cruel, without reasoning, and all in all, evil.

its theoretically possible, but unlikely, several squid and octopus species do consistantly attack people, however none of them can actually ingest human meat (The octopus and squids throat is surrounded by there brain, so anything that would require any significant level of expansion WILL cause severe brain damage to a squid or octopus

The ensuing prosecution of the four men is considered a landmark case and precedent, and is taught in first-year law school to this day, both for its legal importance and its grisly ick factor. 

Essentially, the Court found that necessity was no defense for cannibalism under the law, and that the men were guilty of murder and cannibalism - the heinousness of the crime supersedes the exigencies of necessity.

The precedent has been partially overturned in some jurisdictions. 

An opportunity to offer a fresh test of the rule in full has yet to materialise.

It's funny, we studied the trial of the captain of the second story in criminal law. A whole debate on whether there was intent to kill, and fault for the young man's death. The captain was pardoned, but there was strong evidence for at least a manslaughter conviction because the captain had reason to know that the ship wasn't sea worthy (he decided to sail the dilapidated boat, instead of using part of his commission to get it fixed up first).

The Poe story would have made the whole thing more interesting.

This is actually a legal case we learned about in Criminal Law over here! The case is called R v Dudley and Stephens and was an important case in deciding whether the defence of necessity could ever be used when charged with murder, which the judges held could not be the case. It's a  fairly long and arduous judgement but they were both found guilty of murder and sentenced to death before being granted an official pardon by Queen Victoria and serving just 6 months imprisonment. Still, a pretty unfortunate thing to happen, especially for poor Mr. Parker.

To add to the story, the men went on trial for murder once they were rescued and all they had to do was lie but one of them chose to tell the truth about what happened and they received the death penalty as a result.   
  
The Avett Brothers named an album after this ship and in the insert had a summary of this story.  I always took it to be a statement about being honest and true at all costs.

I know a few people with relatives gone missing there. Mostly Native women. Robert Pickton was charged for the murders of some missing women. He apparently fed them to his pigs. Such a sad sad area. There is so much distance between the cities on that highway. People are always hitch-hiking from cities like Prince George and travelling to Vancouver. I only hope that it stops and many of the families affected by the Highway of Tears can find closure one day.

Edit: I don't know much about the Robert Pickton case but it did involve many missing women. Yet I found out about another guy linked to the missing women from the highway of tears http://www.vancouversun.com/news/RCMP+believe+there+more+than+Highway+Tears+killer/7297179/story.html .

*First paragraph [from wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_tears):*

---

**Highway 16** is the British Columbia, Canada, section of the Yellowhead Highway. The highway closely follows the path of the northern B.C. alignment of the Canadian National Railway. The number "16" was first given to the highway in 1942, and originally, the route that the highway took was more to the north of today's highway, and it was not as long as it is now. Highway 16 originally ran from New Hazelton east to an obscure location known as Aleza Lake. In 1947, Highway 16's western end was moved from New Hazelton to the coastal city of Prince Rupert, and in 1953, the highway was extended all the way east into Yellowhead Pass. Highway 16's alignment on the Haida Gwaii was commissioned in 1984, with BC Ferries beginning service along Highway 16 to the Haida Gwaii the following year.

Seems like this is only a theory and has a lot of evidence against it.  The eruption definitely happened, but the decrease in human population because of it is debatable.

For example: " ancient stone tools in southern India were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the Toba eruption and were very similar across these layers, suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population.  Additional archaeological evidence from southern and northern India also suggests a lack of evidence for effects of the eruption on local populations, leading the authors of the study to conclude, "many forms of life survived the supereruption, contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks"."

It does say that the plant life was really affected and because of this, Humans had to adapt and come up with different survival strategies.

"The Toba catastrophe theory suggests that a bottleneck of the human population occurred c. 70,000 years ago, reducing the total human population to c. 15,000 individuals."..."This suggests that the female line ancestry of all present-day humans traces back to a single female (Mitochondrial Eve) at around 140,000 years ago, and the male line to a single male (Y-chromosomal Adam) at 60,000 to 90,000 years ago."

So if the eruption was ~70,000 years ago, and if this theory is correct, there could have very well been just ONE dude to 15,000 women. Man, imagine that guy...

Other research has cast doubt on the genetic bottleneck theory. For example, ancient stone tools in southern India were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the Toba eruption and were very similar across these layers, suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population.[36][37][38] Additional archaeological evidence from southern and northern India also suggests a lack of evidence for effects of the eruption on local populations, leading the authors of the study to conclude, "many forms of life survived the supereruption, contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks".[39] However, evidence from pollen analysis has suggested prolonged deforestation in South Asia, and some researchers have suggested that the Toba eruption may have forced humans to adopt new adaptive strategies, which may have permitted them to replace Neanderthals and "other archaic human species".[40] This has been challenged by evidence for the presence of Neanderthals in Europe and Homo floresiensis in Southeastern Asia who survived the eruption by 50,000 and 60,000 years, respectively.[41]

Just to elaborate: Rasputin cured the tsar's son from haemophilia, a disease where his blood wouldn't clot when he started to bleed. Rasputin did nothing but holding the doctors away from the tsar's son. Those doctors where fond of the newly invented the aspirin which, as we know now, works blood thinning. The disease cured by itself after a while, like it does most of the time.

This won Rasputin the tsar's confidence. Especially his wife liked Rasputin so much because they thought he had magical powers. He stayed with the tsar as personal advisor. He had as much friends as he had enemies, but among the enemies where some Russian generals who thought his influence was gettig to big, so they tried to kill him.

That's not completely true. It was a British Secret Service agent that shot him. The British Government thought Rasputin was trying to convince the Russian royal family to sign an armistice with Germany, which would allow Germany to focus its military strength on the western front, which in turn could have been detrimental to the British war effort. Therefore, the forerunner to MI6 had one of their agents, Oswald Rayner, do the dead with the help of Prince Yusupov. They invited Rasputin for tea, lured him to the basement, and Rayner shot him. The bullets (there were at least four) were found to have come from a Webley revolver, the standard issue gun given to British spies working in Russia at the time. After that they threw his already dead body into the river.

The reason the poison had no effect was because they laced the bread with it **before** baking it, simply baking the poison out. There was nothing left web Rasputin ate it. That prince Yusipov shot him afterwards and he didn't die, well that is a whole other story...

Hasn't this largely been debunked? The only records of it happening this way are by the murderers themselves who wanted to portray Rasputin as a monster. In fact one if the accounts state that he didn't eat any of the poisoned food at all and pathologists believed he died shortly after being shot and was most likely thrown into the river afterwards. It's a shame too, I always loved this story about Rasputin being ridiculously difficult to kill.

Historians differ on the accuracy of the account of Rasputin's death.  While to our modern ear it makes him sound like an unimaginable badass, the story of Rasputin's death comes to us mostly through his killers who, understandably, didn't like the guy or his politics.

In depicting Rasputin as somehow immune to poison, stabbing, shooting, bludgeoning, etc they portray him as supernatural -- perhaps demonic -- and his death by drowning fits well into that kind of mythology.  

So while it's possible that Rasputin really was among the hardest people in recorded history to kill, its somewhat more likely that he was the victim of a botched poisoning, finished off by a revolver, dumped in the Niva, and then -- like many things pulled from a river -- the subject of exaggeration and self-serving fictions.

Rasputin was immune to cyanide due to eating apple cores as a child. The seeds of an apple contain a small amount of cyanide in them, and over time he built up a resistance. They laced that cool cats food with cyanide, and due to the immunity he survived.

I've read a lot of research on ballistics and the effects of bullets on the human body. It's absolutely *amazing* how many places you have where a bullet can slip right through and not damage anything important. There are even more places where it will kill you, but not for the next day or two.

It's actually fairly common to have bullets bounce off the skull or large bones as well, especially pistol bullets in small calibers.

I read of one gunfight where the first hint the cop had that someone was shooting at him was when he got shot in the face. He just thought he'd been punched until he felt that his teeth were sideways in his mouth. He returned fire, hit the guy in a major artery on his first shot. It was a mortal wound, but the suspect fired another five shots before the cop wrestled him to the ground and finished him. The cop survived.

So, anyway, doesn't necessarily take anything creepy for that story to be true, just some lucky trajectories.

You did forget an interesting one. He had survived an assassination attempt previously when a hired prostitute gutted him in the street. As in, she ran a knife across his torso and he had to get down and scoop his innards back, ya know, in. Funnily enough, it was this injury which is rumored to have prevented him from eating those poisonous cakes (a. they only poisoned the cakes b. he couldn't eat sweets after his intestines went out for fresh air that one time). See /u/jdoe3351's comment below regarding further efficacy of these rumors.

Don't forget that during his cremation he was said to have come back to life. His corpse was said to have leaped out of the fire while it was a flame. 

While many people at the time thought he had risen himself from the dead due to his supernatural powers, more modern thinking suggests that in their haste to burn his body, they didn't prepare his body adequately for cremation. So when they started to burn him, all of his ligaments seized up and became rigid, effectively making him sit up with his arms and legs raised out and move around.

Pretty terrifying if you saw it happen though.

From yahoo answers regarding his poisoning: 

>Modern writers, using newly available Bolshevik and Soviet-era official documents, claim that the post-mortem found no trace of poison, and that Rasputin died simply of gunshot wounds. He was no harder to kill than any other mortal, and stories of him repeatedly rising from the dead that night originate solely with his killers-who were merely trying to turn a squalid murder into an act of demon-slaying heroism

whats also creepy is that there are writings of him that indicate that he was about to influence the russian leader to make peace with germany. there are also some files which indicate that the brits didnt like this so mi6 agents killed him.

would have russia made peace, the germans could have focussed on western europe and would have possibly won the war.

since this didnt happen germany funded lenin with insanely high amounts of money to start the soviet revolution, thinking they would put a puppet into power which then makes peace.

but lenin had no intention of playing the puppet and funded the german worker revolution instead, which led to formation of the weimarer republic and made hitlers rise to power possible, along with ww2 and the cold war.

This is about true stories, most of this is fiction.

- they never found poison in his body

- It was said he ate poisoned cake and wine, which is also wrong, because he couldn't eat sweets anymore after the failed assassination a few years ago. 

Most likely they tortured him, based on the signs on his body. also, his balls where squeezed. cold water can do a lot of crazy stuff, but not stuff like this.

A couple details I remembered hearing was that he happened to do arsenic as a drug thus bolstering his immunity. That is what they poisoned him with. 

Also when I heard it told originally, they cut off his head arms and legs, and the way I heard it there *was* water in his lungs meaning his lungs were still breathing after having his limbs and head removed.

It's believed that with arsenic, he used immurement, which is systematically giving yourself small amounts of poison in order to build an immunity for it. This man had enough foresight to realize that people would try to do this shit to him.

I have no fucking idea how he survived the shots, though.

An interesting part though, is that when he was burned after death for cremation, he appeared to try to stand up after being shot, being poisoned, being cold, and being thrown in the river. The priest who was burning him saw him fucking move, only adding to the rumors that he's terrifying. The reason for this is that the priest was inexperienced, and didn't cut the tendons, which when heated caused it to bend, making it look like a body was actually moving.

Interestingly enough, he supposedly cured the Romanov son through hypnotism. The reason that they believed that this worked had something to do with the fact that hemophilia prevents blood from coagulating, but hypnotism (whether effective at convincing people to do things or not) has the ability to relax someone immensely, making their blood flow very slowly. With the slow blood flow, the heart was pumping less to the broken skin area,which mean less would come out.

They also botched his cremation and the fire wasn't hot enough and they never cut his tendons, so as they shrank in the heat, he appeared to dance in the flames.

wasn't it reported that he suffocated, not drowned?  The difference being that he instead of letting the river be the cause of his death, he held his breath until he died instead?  A feat that is said to be impossible as one would gasp for air (thus inhaling water and drowning) but Rasputin had the willpower to not?

I read that somewhere, I forget where.   Thus not sourced

Also, when they found his body, they wanted to be sure that he was dead, so the they burned him. They said that while he was burning though, he moved around, so they thought he was still alive.

Thing about burning a body is that the tendons have to be cut so they don't tighten up. When tendons tighten up they can make it seem like a body is moving, sitting up, jerking around, etc.

The reason the poison didn't kill him was because they used a type of cyanide that is only poisonous when it comes in contact with a certain level of acidity. This usually happens when it reaches the victim's stomach but Rasputin's stomach acid levels were far from the norm at the time and the poison passed right through without being triggered.

 http://www.fromoldbooks.org/Gallonio-TorturesAndTorments/text-chapter1/section12.html  

Similar forms of torture may be found in plenty described in Lucian’s Dialogue entitled Lucius, or the Ass, wherein the following story is related: “We must discover,” he then said, “some sort of death whereby this maiden may endure long-drawn and bitter torment.... So let us kill this ass, and afterwards cut open its belly and after removing the inwards, shut up the girl inside in such a way that only her head be left outside (this to prevent her being entirely suffocated), while the rest of her body be hid within the carcase. Then, when this hath been sewn up, let us expose them both to the vultures—a strange meal prepared in a new and strange fashion. Now just consider the nature of this torture, I beg you. To begin with, a living woman will be shut up inside a dead ass; then by reason of the heat of the sun will she be roasted within its belly; further, she will be tormented with mortal hunger, yet entirely unable to destroy herself. Yet other features of her agony, both from the stench of the dead body as it rots, and the swarm of writhing worms, I say nothing of. Lastly, the vultures that feed on the carcase will rend in pieces the living woman at the same time. All shouted assent to this monstrous proposal, and unanimously approved its being put in execution.”

*actually*, the tube was so that the victim could breathe slightly cooler air, and then scream into it, which would purportedly only sound like the mewling of a calf after it travelled through the long spiral.

The brazen bull was used once, or possibly twice, in all of history. It was not a judicial punishment meted out to criminals.
  
Also, iron maidens are fake. They never existed historically. The ones in museums are relatively modern fabrications that were never used on anyone.
  
Anal pears and Judas chairs are also all fake. All the wacky old torture devices are all made up. Real life involved much less extravagant torture and execution methods.

Look up Ambrose Bierce, satirist and author of "Devil's Dictionary." He also was a Union army officer during the war and served at Shiloh. He writes a likewise-chilling account called "What I Saw at Shiloh" which describes, in detail, a similar scene....read it here: http://www.classicreader.com/book/1165/1/

That bomber pilot went crazy, utterly insane. He managed to overpower his co-pilot and steer the plane North, where he intentionally crashed it into the British RAF base in Gibraltar... The Man himself later explained to me that that pilot had been suffering from a brain tumor which, at that moment, influenced that decision.

 The plane was carrying nuclear material, which was spread in the manner of a dirty bomb detonation when the plane's fuel tanks exploded and ignited a large gasoline storage tank in the base, producing a sizeable explosion. This was witnessed by the captain of a United States Forrest-Sherman-Class Destroyer which was headed out of the Mediterranian Sea at the time. Due to the distance, he could not properly ascertain the size of the explosion, but picked up the radiation of the resulting cloud of radioactive material on the ship's Geiger counter, thus making the fatal mistake of confusing the explosion for a nuclear detonation. He seems to have panicked at that point because in his message to Washington, he kept rambling about a Soviet nuclear pre-emptive strike on European military installations along the coast of the mediterranian sea. A lot of people reacted in a very rash manner in the next few hours... Long short story, after the United States started their entire strategic bomber fleet and Russian intelligence got conflicting news of a large-scale exchange between British and Russian forces in the mediterranian (which was entirely fictional and originated from an agent who was at the time suffering from delusions), World War III happened. Half of the human race did not survive the next decade. 

That was the time when The Man appeared. He didn't call himself The Man, but that's what I remember, him being the first Man I had seen in a long time - damn if I can remember what he called himself... He was, that we are quite sure of, not a human being, although he physically resembled one. He talked to me personally at the time (it was 1969), trying to find out what happened to the planet. I distinctly remember him saying that 1969 was a fixed point in time that was about to be altered: A human being had to set foot on the moon on July 20, which was, at the time, impossible because we had effectively bombed ourselves back into the stone ages. The Man implied that it was possible for him to take a human being there, if neccessary, but that that was not how it was supposed to happen. He said that a particular video tape of the moon landing was what was important, one that was longer than it was supposed to be... I can not claim to understand half of it. 

The Man also said that the crash of the B-47 was not a fixed point and could be altered. I would have taken him for just another nutjob then - the human race had not exactly retained its sanity after the war was over. Of course, it was never really over, but the last atomic bomb had been detonated almost eight years ago and there were about a thousand groups claiming to be the United States or the Soviet Union, fighting each other with old rifles, the occasional mortar or landmine, sticks, stones and their bruised fists. 

I would have thought The Man was a madman - which was a thing he called himself, by the way - if not for his clothing. In a charred wasteland of endless war, he strolled into my little safehouse in a perfectly new, clean three-piece suit. Now, you can't know what the world was like after the bombs had fallen, but let me tell you: When I saw him entering, I truly thought the suit was a miracle. There was nothing, could be nothing as clean and undamaged in the entire world. 

I don't know why I remember it all - because The Man went back. He told me he'd fix things and then he walked out again. There was a noise, then he was gone. Then there was confusion, I lost my consciousness, then I was back in my bed again and the year was 1956, the day after the war had started. Except it hadn't. I called friends and acquaintances everywhere, asked about the bombs, about the Russians and finally about the plane. It turned out that it had disappeared without a trace... They later locked me in a mental ward for a few weeks after I kept telling them about World War III, that was when I learned to shut my mouth. Hell, I stopped believing it myself at some point, started thinking they were right, that I was a right down regular nutcase. 

Except, of course, The Man came back. He looked differently, dressed differently, different face, different hair, different everything, looking younger than before - but it was him alright, and he knew me. Must have been about this time last year, I guess... We had some tea then. Now I know I've always been right, that the War was real and The Man was real, and I'm too old for them to lock me into a madhouse again. They'll just say I'm going a bit senile, so it's alright. I didn't imagine that second visit, either - he left me his number. I call him from time to time.

Sounds to me like it crashed and, this being the height of the Cold War, it was easier to say, "It disappeared without a trace," rather than, "Yeah, dumped some nuclear stuff in the ocean by mistake, our bad.  Hey, don't try and pull it up, okay?"

I think it is more creepy how many times we came close to nuclear armageddon due to accidents. 

One I remember was we had a bomber always flying over Greenland with a sort of early warning post at a base there. The plane had a malfunction coming in for landing to fuel and was going down, crew bailed but the pilot did his best to direct it away from the post. The bombs it was carrying were later found to have major safety issues and could have (but didn't) detonate in the crash. 

The plane had only been in contact with the post and the post hadn't notified the mainland about the incident. Had the plane crashed at the post and be the bombs gone off the US would have only known that suddenly a missile early warning post had disappeared...

Another story from the 23rd January, 1961. A B-52 bomber with two four-megaton nuclear bombs, each bigger than all detonated nuclear weapons combined up until then, crashed in North Carolina. If it hadn't been for a single untouched mechanism, the bombs would have detonated and there would be a bay where North Carolina is today.

Basically any aircraft that has disappeared anywhere near Bermuda triangle we've figured out was probably crashed by Methane.  Boats too.  Tons of methane suddenly seeping up in a shift would screw up localized buoyancy in a large enough event and the column of methane gas could choke an aircraft's engine.

It also could have been thousands of other things. A B-47 would have less lightning strike resistance than modern aircraft.  Could have fried all their equipment and they went down silent.

Also worth noting is that the it was flying with 3 other B-47s at the time. Crazy that it could just disappear with out any communication or anyone seeing anything.

That was most likely propaganda. Nations usually conduct smear campaigns before they are planning an invasion (check out the 'Kuwaiti incubator babies' story or the tale about Saddam's sons throwing people in acid vats). 

Just before he was assassinated by proxy, I remember papers here in the UK insisting that Gaddafi was keeping corpses of his victims in bins outside his residence and using schools to draw fire of allied jet fighters.

It seems like you don't really need evidence anymore; appealing to emotion is far more effective.

That was messed up. It seems the hotel has a very sorted history. Suicides, serial killers and that tuberculosis thing, there's something not right there. The police kind of just swept this case under the rug. How could she even get into the water tank? And where is her family? The police just said she was 'probably bipolar', no family to back up any claims of a mental health history. This whole thing is just so bizarre.

I saw a pretty interesting theory about this that made a lot of sense. She dropped acid before this.

The person pointed out that her hand motions are similar to the hand motions of someone who is hallucinating on acid. Most likely she took a huge dose, and started hallucinating. She became paranoid and feared that someone was watching her. Look at how close she gets to the buttons. She has her face right in front of them, probably to stop them from melting off the side of the elevator. In her confusion, she pushed a ton of random buttons including the door open button. 

She finally walked out, and finished her trip. In her trip she walked onto the roof. Acid causes heat hallucinations, and a desire for water. She probably was seeking out the only way to quench that through climbing into the water tank. Unfortunately, she was too stoned to swim, and died. 

tl;dr Not creepy, she was on drugs. 

EDIT: Oh.....no traces of drugs..... well fuck that idea, I guess. I am going with some sort of psychotic episode. Yeah, that's it. 

EDIT 2: Yeah, I guess I hadn't read the full story. Sorry about that.

It is clear to me that she is drunk, and someone is trying to coax her out of the elevator. She starts out by playfully hiding from them, and then tries to explain why she should leave (counting on her fingers at one point). The other person eventually convinces her to come back. My guess is that she and another person (people) were drunk/ high, were fooling around the water tanks and she fell in. When the other person/ people sobered up the next day they decided to keep the incident a secret.

Maybe she was just playing around? Once the doors wouldn't shut maybe she was just having fun or something. I'm by all respect a "normal" person, but sometimes it's just fun to do spontaneous things. Like dance around when no one's watching. Or in this case wave her arms around or play with the sensors on the elevator since she likely didn't know why it wasn't closing. I really didn't think the video was creepy at all since I took it as her just having some fun.

1922, likely someone living in the forest came and killed them for food or the like.  1922 puts it 4 years after the end of WWI, meaning germany would probably be closing in on total economic collapse due to war reparations.  Possible someone from another town, lost everything and was looking to survive however he/she could.

Hinterkaifeck bears a lot of similarity to the [Villisca Axe Murders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villisca_Axe_Murders) that occured ten years earlier in Iowa.

> The Moore family consisted of parents Josiah (aged 43), Sarah (39), and their four children: Herman (11), Katherine (10), Boyd (7) and Paul (5). An affluent family, the Moores were well-known and well-liked in their community.[1] On June 9, 1912, Katherine Moore invited Ina (8) and Lena (12) Stillinger to spend the night at the Moore residence. That evening, the visiting girls and the Moore family attended the Presbyterian church where they participated in the Children's Day Program, which Sarah Moore had coordinated. After the program ended at 9:30 p.m., the Moores and the Stillinger sisters walked to the Moores' house, arriving between 9:45 and 10 p.m.

> At 7 a.m. the next day, Mary Peckham, the Moores' neighbor, became concerned after she noticed that the Moore family had not come out to do their morning chores. Peckham knocked on the Moores' door. When nobody answered, she tried to open the door and discovered that it was locked. Peckham let the Moores' chickens out and then called Ross Moore, Josiah Moore's brother. Like Peckham, Moore received no response when he knocked on the door and shouted. He unlocked the front door with his copy of the house key. While Peckham stood on the porch, Moore went into the parlor and opened the guest bedroom door and found Ina and Lena Stillinger's bodies on the bed. Moore immediately told Peckham to call Hank Horton, Villisca's primary peace officer, who arrived shortly thereafter. Horton's search of the house revealed that the entire Moore family and the two Stillinger girls had been bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon, an ax belonging to Josiah, was found in the guest room where the Stillinger sisters were found.

> Doctors concluded that the murders had taken place between midnight and 5 a.m.[2] The killer or killers began in the master bedroom, where Josiah and Sarah Moore were asleep. Josiah received more blows from the ax than any other victim; his face had been cut so much that his eyes were missing. The killer(s) then went into the children's rooms and bludgeoned Herman, Katherine, Boyd, and Paul in the head in the same manner as their parents. Afterward, the killer(s) moved downstairs to the guest bedroom and killed Ina and Lena.

> Investigators believed that all of the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep at the time of the murders. Investigators also believed Lena attempted to fight back. She was found lying crosswise on the bed, and a defensive wound was discovered on her arm. Furthermore, Lena was found with her nightgown pushed up to her waist and no undergarments on, leading to speculation that the killer(s) sexually molested her or attempted to do so.

I came up with my own theory about this (disclaimer: entirely pulled out of my ass with no factual backup whatsoever) when I first read about this case on /r/UnresolvedMysteries (like crack for mystery fans, check it out).

The daughter Viktoria had been widowed in WWI, if I recall correctly, her husband described as KIA. In WWI, AKA a time when thousands of men were dying daily and it was impossible to keep accurate records. So lets imagine that hubby doesn't die. He is injured, captured or loses his mind, or any combination of the three. For whatever reason (take your pick: disability, poverty, external constraints), it takes him four years to get back home, and for whatever other reason (again, take your pick: he was presumed dead, he was insane, he had been maimed in some way) he hides his arrival from the family and takes refuge in the attic (hence the footsteps and attic noises). He may or may not discover the incestuous relationship between Viktoria and her father whilst he's there. Even if he wasn't already insane, that could drive most people over the edge. For this reason, or for some other reason only he can know (he feels they abandoned him/gave up on him too readily, he is insane) he kills everyone and buggers off into the night, never to be seen again (until tonight, when a flash of lightning illuminates his wrinkled, scar-ridden face outside your bedroom window...just playing).

It's not watertight but it seems more convincing to me than other explanations I've encountered.

Edit: Prompted by my own post, I've done more reading on the subject. Hubby's body was never found, but apparently consensus online is it's unlikely he's responsible. However whilst learning this I also learnt that Viktoria had slept around quite a bit in the village, and was apparently the first one to be killed. So how about this: village dude sneaks over for fun with Viktoria, they argue, he kills her, panics, lures rest of family in one by one and kills them too, then disappears.

I've always thought that this particular tidbit of the case was of high interest:  "The death of Karl Gabriel, Viktoria's husband who had been reported killed in the French trenches in 1914, was called into question. His body had never been found."

Think about it.  He's reported killed but what if he survived?  Deserted and spent eight years hiding out to avoid the authorities.  Finally the war is over and the Weimar Republic begins to shudder along.  The economy collapses.  He's driven from town to town, plying whatever skills he might have or possibly just stealing to survive.  Eventually he makes his way back to the lands north of Munich, lands he remembers.  His feet carry him to his wife's father's farm, where he decides to check in on his family, who he assumes has long since given up on him.  He discovers that his wife has been sleeping with her own father and has an incestuous child with him.  Driven into an insane, disgusted rage, he manages to lure the family out to the barn and murders them one by one.

Horrible crime.  What also surprises me is that Hollywood has not made a movie of this?  How often do studios release possession movies and present them as based on true events?  THIS WAS A REAL MURDER.  Apparently the assailant(s) was living in the home for months (if the first maid's haunted house theory was him shifting around the premises).

Dear God!

Wiki:

> Subsequent investigation by forensic pathologists determined D4, being exposed to the highest pressure gradient, violently exploded due to the rapid and massive expansion of internal gases. All of his thoracic and abdominal organs, and even his thoracic spine, were ejected, as were all of his limbs. Simultaneously, his remains were expelled through the narrow trunk opening left by the jammed chamber door, less than 60 centimetres (24 in) in diameter. Fragments of his body were found scattered about the rig. One part was even found lying on the rig's derrick, 10 metres (30 ft) directly above the chambers.

I did some research for this for my graduation project, and it baffled me how Walter Freeman (developer of this method) is not more well-known. He didn't invent lobotomies as such - there was an older version referred to as leucotomy that were only to be utilized in extreme cases, according to the inventor (who received a nobel prize for this in 1947). These were carried out by drilling a hole in to the patient's forehead instead of going through the eyelids.

Freeman, however, started using an ice-pick he seemingly found in one of his drawers. He rarely washed up before surgery as he didn't "care about any of that germ crap".

I found it very fascinating how "showy" he was about this whole thing. as /u/LorzBinding mentioned, he had a van set up which he actually named the Lobotomobile. He often "performed" in front of an audience, and would sometimes perform 2 lobotomies at once: one with each hand. He claimed lobotomies to be a universal cure (not just to psychological but also physical ailments) and some reports state that he performed circa 3,500 lobotomies in his career. 

He would also often send Christmas cards to his former patients.

Fun fact: John F. Kennedy's sister Rosemary had a lobotomy when she was 23, because her family decided she was "mentally unstable."  Here's how badly it got fucked up, from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary_Kennedy#Lobotomy):



*"We went through the top of the head, I think she was awake. She had a mild tranquilizer. I made a surgical incision in the brain through the skull. It was near the front. It was on both sides. We just made a small incision, no more than an inch." The instrument Dr. Watts used looked like a butter knife. He swung it up and down to cut brain tissue. "We put an instrument inside," he said. As Dr. Watts cut, Dr. Freeman put questions to Rosemary. For example, he asked her to recite the Lord's Prayer or sing "God Bless America" or count backwards. ... "We made an estimate on how far to cut based on how she responded." ... When she began to become incoherent, they stopped.*

After the lobotomy, it quickly became apparent that the procedure was not successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two year old child. She could not walk, speak intelligibly and was incontinent.

Some more facts to spice this up: the van was called the lobotomobile and he drove it around like a band going on your, performing lobotomies as he went, very often in living rooms and offices and not in medical facilities. He would often lobotomies individuals simply based on word of mouth that they were difficult or disorderly. He also carried on his lobotomies ing til well after if had fallen out of favor with the medical community. He was bound and determined that it would be the saving grace operation and so continued to lobotomize a couple dozen more people after the medical community turned against him. Also he won the Nobel peace prize in psychological medicine. His name was Moniz. 

Though I will say that the youngest I've heard of him lobotomies ing someone was 11 or 12 so I think you may be over exaggerating with the 4

Yeah, we watched a video on the Ice Pick Lobotomy in my 11th grade English class after analyzing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I wasn't doing too well with it. And by "wasn't doing well" I mean thinking about an icepick scraping the frontal lobe of my brain through my eye socket apparently made me nauseous enough to lose consciousness and fracture my skull on the tile floor in the middle of class. Only bone I ever broke, too. It wasn't fun for anyone. Just ask my teacher who was constantly giving me extra credit for fear of some kind of lawsuit.

So yeah, you're not the only one who gets ill thinking about it. But on the bright side, it makes for a fun story at parties.

TL;DR: Watched video on lobotomies, ended up giving myself one after.

Reminds me of "The Bloop" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloop
>Fox's hunch is that the sound nicknamed Bloop is the most likely to come from some sort of animal, because its signature is a rapid variation in frequency similar to that of sounds known to be made by marine beasts. There's one crucial difference, however: in 1997 Bloop was detected by sensors up to 4800 kilometres apart. That means it must be far louder than any whale noise, or any other animal noise for that matter. Is it even remotely possible that some creature bigger than any whale is lurking in the ocean depths? Or, perhaps more likely, something that is much more efficient at making sound?

>Courville and Percy decided to test Tarrare's capacity for food. A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep;Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.

Allegedly this British Solider saved Hitler's life:

>"The story relates that a weary German soldier wandered into Tandey's line of fire. The enemy soldier was wounded and did not even attempt to raise his own rifle. Tandey chose not to shoot. The German soldier saw him lower his rifle and nodded his thanks before wandering off. That soldier is purported to have been Adolf Hitler."

Hitler really just wanted to be an artist. The Academy of Fine Arts  rejected him twice, once in 1907 and again in 1908. He sucked at selling his paintings on the street (to be fair, it seems like a rough way to make a living in any slum), & by 1909 he lived in a homeless shelter in Vienna. The city is described as "a hotbed of religious prejudice and racism" of the times, following a large influx of Eastern immigrants. Both the government & church of the city promoted antisemitism & nationalism.

Things might have been worse... I mean Hitler was a f@*%ing c&£t and all, the thing he did/cause were nothing less than horrifying atrocities but let us play Devil's Advocate for a moment:
We cannot know for sure, then in a parallel trouser leg of time, in which Hitler died before doing all the s**t he did, that the world wasn't an inexorably worse place. Perpahs if Hitler hadn't taken to the stage and grabbed the spotlight, an even more skilful and villainous character would have come into play. 

We can never know if things would have been better or worse, so lets just assume they could be worse and let us try to make them better.

Well if he had died. The world might have been different in that a similar group of Nazis may have been successful under different leadership.

When people say they'd go back in time and kill Hitler, it seems like a big risk. In our version he eventually lost. Which also gives us a society that can see the dangers of that kind of extremism and where it can lead.

Also a British soldier Private Henry Tandey had an injured German in his sights in 1918, He just couldn't bring himself to pull the trigger. That German's name? ~~Albert Einstein~~ Adolf Hitler. 

Later when in talks with Neville Chamberlain, Adolf Hitler saw [this painting] (http://victoriacross.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/tandey.jpg) the man in the foreground was our own Private Tandey and Hitler reportedly said

 "that man came so near to killing me that I thought I should never see Germany again, providence saved me from such devilishly accurate fire as those English boys were aiming at us."

Of course this could all be bullshit. However it was corroborated first by Hitler then by Tandey, Maybe it's another possible instance where it seems Hitler beat all odds to stay alive and accomplish his terrible deeds.

The Jewish banker / globalist centralizers would have taken over the first world much earlier, their "NSA" spy network would be vastly greater, and we would have far less technology available to us.

Am I supposed to believe Hitler was bad for the world?

Actually, baby Hitler was killed by Katherine Heigl by jumping into an icy river.  The maid that was supposed to be watching baby Hitler, in a panic, bought a baby from a homeless person, which then became the real Hitler.  Then Forest Whitaker.

Operation Valkyrie also failed, it was an assassination attempt on Hitler through a briefcase with a bomb in it. The briefcase was originally placed next to Hitler, but by chance some one scooched it. It instead detonated at the table's foot leg and the table shielded Hitler from the explosion.
Here's a map of what happen and where everyone was seated: http://craunkids.pbworks.com/f/1262135490/605px-20_July_Conference_Room_Floorplan_svg.png

One of the very best performances in movie history, performed in one take, after filming had to shut down due to Shaw being too drunk to do the scene he did it the next day.  Or something like that.  he should get some kind of award for his performance in that film, he nailed that role so incredibly.

Funny you should mention this. My grandfather was on that sub, the USS *Finback*. It's been a story we've told around the family for decades. After my grandfather (we called him "Popeye" fittingly enough) passed away, we donated a number of his personal items to the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, one of which was a photo album from the *Finback* which included pictures of Bush getting hoisted aboard out of the water, and a swatch from his yellow rubber life vest that was signed by all members of the crew. Pretty incredible sensation having such a significant part of history in your living room.

Your version of the events is inaccurate. According to your source there were only 3 servicemen aboard President Bush's plane. The other two died on impact and Bush swam to safety. There were many prisoners held on the island. Only 8 were killed and a rogue officer served the LIVERS of the men as sort of ritual feeding. Not their whole bodies.Your version was sensationalized it a bit.

Not quite.
 
JAMES BRADLEY: You always hear the phrase, "against the Geneva Convention." That the Japanese did disobeyed the Geneva Convention. Ridiculous, they didn't consider the Geneva Convention. When the emperor declared war on the United States, he specifically left out any mention of honoring international agreements.

Narrator: Without international protections, Japanese officers on Chichijima, like Major Suo (ph) Matoba were able to commit crimes so horrible, they hadn't even been specifically outlawed in the rules of war.

JAMES BRADLEY: And in this guy's twisted, brutal mind, the Japanese spirit could be fed, could be heightened by the killing of American POWs. And then subsequently, actually consuming their livers in terms of getting the spirit out of the enemy.

* From the transcript it says Bush had only two other crewmembers on his plane, ejected from his plane and swam away from the island and was later picked up by an American sub. As is happens, the crewmembers hadn't ejected and went down with the plane; over the course of other missions during the war, eight flyers were taken as POWs, later killed and cannibalized by doctor. All the same, it's pretty chilling considering how different the world would be if he hadn't survived.

The link doesn't support your version of the story.  It says 8 US servicement died on Chichijima OVER THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE WAR, most by beheading.  It was certainly not the crew of the Grumman TBM Avenger which Bush bailed out of, [which carred only a crew of three](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush#World_War_II).  Both died, and considering one was still in the plane and the other's parachute didn't open, it's unlikely either survived to be captured and then eaten.

Anyone interested in learning more about this, read "Flyboys" by James Bradley. He also wrote "Flags of our Fathers."  The book really gives a great account of the Japanese mindset prior to and during the Pacific War. I never knew much about The Rape of China or  what was occurring during WWII with Japan. It was a incredible, nonjudgmental view of that time.

I think you've got the facts a little messed up. There were about that many men captured during the bombing of chichi Jima, but not all on one aircraft. George Bush flew the Avenger, a 3 man plane. James Bradley (same author as Flags of our Fathers) wrote an incredible book about all that happened on and over Chichi Jima called Flyboys, I highly recommend it.

From my memory, there were two other men on the plane Bush was flying. He doesnt know what happened to them. Maybe the number is wrong but there is no evidence that they were eaten. Cannibalism of 'Flyboys' did happen. It just may not have occurred in this instance. What the Japanese leaders did was eat their livers for the most part. It was to gain their strength supposedly. They did much worse things to POWs and Flyboys though. Like force feeding them lbs of rice and making them drink water to expand their stomachs only to stomp on them and have them burst and slowly die. Cannibalism was mostly an issue in the Australian regions due to poor supply. They kept Allied POWs alive as they hacked away at them in order to keep the meat fresh, due to the heat. They'd keep them in pits and slowly eat them.

That reminds me of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. by Haruku Murakami, a dark, amazing story that at one point explores the inevitability of evil men and that they have a function in society.  
A man is given a gun by the bad guy and told to kill him. The man tries but the bullets just won't kill him, bouncing all around the room.  

It was a pretty minor scene, but it always stuck with me.  Anyway: great book.

The Japanese pilot who was the first to attack the US mainland tried to firebomb the redwood forests in Oregon in 1942 which resulted in failure due to a rather wet season. In the 60s he came back and gave his 400 year old samurai sword to the mayor of the town in repentance. Then in the 90s he returned once again to plant a redwood seedling. http://web.oregon.com/history/hm/japanese_attack.cfm

I recently read the book Flyboys by James Bradley, which covers the Chichijima incident and the war in the Pacific in great detail.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the story.

Also, nine servicemen were not on board Bush's plane - 3 were.  He was the only one who survived, being rescued by a US submarine.

Another interesting part of the event is that one of the planes was hit bad and the people aboard thought it would crash... so 2 of the crew members parachuted out and were captured by the Japanese.  The crazy part is that the plane didnt wind up crashing, the pilot wound up landing on an aircraft carrier.  The 2 guys who were captured had the livers eaten.  Sad stuff but it was not like this was a common practice among the Japanese, rather that of a few crazed and desperate officers.

Flyboys is extremely unbiased and shows both sides of the story.  The US did some horrible things too (see the bombing of tokyo).

I remember watching a TV special about Spring Break at South Padre Island years ago and it was talking about a girl that was kidnapped, I remember one of the mysteries about it was security footage showing her entering a club but never exiting.
My mind is incredibly foggy about this story, and I can't seem to find any information on it- however it is the reason I do not spring break there! I live in San Antonio, so most of my friends do. Not me.

This is actually not true. It has been proven false since then.

The story never happened. It's complete fiction.

But Bernardito, wasn't it included in the Guinness Book of World Records? Doesn't Wikipedia confirm as true?

Here we get to the interesting part. 

First, the truth: February 1945. It's the final stages of William Slim's brilliant Burma campaign and the British have trapped a Japanese force counting around a thousand men in the islands of Ramree. Instead of surrendering, the Japanese commander chose to take his men across an unblocked route through ten miles of mangrove swamps. Many were already in a bad state entering the swamp. Malaria was rampant. As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through. Out of 900 troops that went into the swamp, 500 made it out. 

The myth: The above story except that by the end 20 troops were captured by the British, the rest were all killed by saltwater crocodiles. This is a 'reported account' from this encounter: *"That night was the most horrible that any member of the ML crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left... Of about 1,000 Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were left alive."*

Why is this a sensationalist myth?

The observer of this is according to most accounts a certain [Bruce Wright](http://books.google.se/books/about/Wildlife_Sketches_Near_and_Far.html?id=Kb9XmQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y) who for some reason was in this swamp where this is said to have taken place, sitting in a motor launch and witnessing this. Yet only Wright's *Wildlife Sketches Near and Far* exists as the single account for this to have happened.

There is no other single source that can verify this event to have happened and the actual survivors themselves that came out of the swamp is enough to disprove this myth. There is no mention of it in official British records and W.O.G. Potts did his own research into this with an incredibly detail investigation in which he interviewed a broad range of people which included Ramree islanders, survivors and soldiers. No one acknowledged that an incident like this had taken place.

Lastly, historian Frank McLynn has this to say in his book *The Burma Campaign*: 

*Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with a exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).*

The Wikipedia writer is overly critical about Frank McLynn in the article, for whatever reason that might be. While McLynn did indeed doubt the existence of Mr. Wright but as pointed out in the *Talk* section of the page in question, there is no evidence that the Wright who wrote the book which had the only account of the incident and the Wright which the Wikipedia page uses as a source (a dubious one at that) is the same person. Secondly, the Wikipedia page makes McLynn seem like someone making claims out of thin air which is ridiculous. He's using scholarly sources to back up his claim and is definitely not the only author doubting this story. (Just see Platt SG, Ko WK, Kalyar Myo M, Khaing LL, Rainwater T. *Man eating by estuarine crocodiles: the Ramree Island massacre revisited.* Herp Bull. 2001;75:15–18)

Since we are talking about animals: a small anecdote about the [Oceanic Whitetip Shark](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/OceanicWT/OceanicWT.html)

*Although primarily found offshore, this shark is considered potentially dangerous It is often the first species to be seen in waters surrounding mid-ocean disasters. During both World Wars, the oceanic whitetip shark was of major concern due to the high number of torpedoed boats and shot-down planes. The Nova Scotia steamship was sunk by torpedoes from a German submarine off the coast of South Africa. Close to 1,000 men were on board, however only 192 survived. It is believed that many of the fatalities were victims of the oceanic whitetip shark in what eyewitness accounts described as a "feeding frenzy".*

Oh god yes. I read about this in one of Peter Hathaway Capstick's books, as an aside to how terrifying crocodiles are, when I was a young teenager. I grew up in an area with a lot of crocs and was always a bit obsessed with them, especially since a lot of my hobbies brought me into dangerous proximity with them. Suffice it to say, the story of Ramree captivated me. I wrote reports and short fiction stories on it for school but I've always wished someone with more talent would turn this into a novel or flesh it out into a historical fiction movie. The trouble is Australian cinema doesn't have Hollywood's production quality, and Hollywood doesn't do crocs well. Like at all. See Rogue and Lake Placid for examples. But this concept, this done well? Would be the absolute tits.

>Eventually, Rathbone's mind deteriorated to the point that on Dec. 23, 1883, he decided to deck the halls with his family's blood. While serving as a U.S. consul in Hanover, Germany, Rathbone tried to kill his three kids, and when his wife stopped him, he fatally shot and stabbed her, then stabbed himself -- mentally replaying Booth's actions from 18 years earlier.
The police found Rathbone covered with blood and completely out of his mind. According to a widely repeated but unconfirmed report, he claimed that there were people hiding behind the pictures on his wall.

If you invert the colors on the coded note, it seems like two people wrote it. Also the first characters on line 1 and 3 don't really look like Ms or Ws, but more like |N|. Annnd there are a lot of random marks and some non-letters in the code. It's weird. Also the last three letters on the last line are sort of personalized, like they're initials and not part of the code.

As I recall the Dyatlov Pass Incident is easily explained by an avalanche.  This killed numerous members of the group (accounting for the broken limbs) and the sudden hypothermia caused the survivors to wander off (which is why there were other members found some distance away) in a dazed state.  As for the missing eye and tongue, what do you think scavenger animals eat first?

The Donner party was a result of Jim Bridger, the guy that basically made the western expansion possible. 

"In 1846, Bridger was at least partially responsible for the tragic journey of the Donner Party, due to his self-interested misdirection of the wagon train through the impractical Hastings Cutoff. Bridger had hoped that the party's successful trip would help bring increased trade to his Fort Bridger, and actively worked to obscure evidence that might hamper this increase in business."

You forgot the part where they were partially undressed.  But that's a known paradoxical reaction to hypothermia, people go crazy and oddly *remove* their clothing in delirium.  That's a documented reaction outside this case.

And really since it's far less easy to explain their state of undress any other way, it's pretty likely they were experiencing hypothermia delirium.  In which case that's pretty much it.  Their bodies were scavenged by animals (pretty much a given).  Broken skull, well that's probably the initial avalanche, or maybe someone with hypothermia got violent or another delirious person thought they had to end their suffering with a rock.

I maintain the vaguely plausible theory that the hikers were killed by an avalanche and/or subsequent hypothermia... initiated by a nearby nuclear test. The blast caused the avalanche, the avalanche killed the hikers, and blast left traces of radiation. Bear in mind this was Soviet Russia - a nuclear test is a reasonable explanation for the radiation and extremely tightlipped official response. And that's if the radiation report is even legitimate, which is debatable.

The worst part of the Donner Party was the gold rush 3 years later.  An army had to travel up from Sacramento to eliminate the quite obvious signs of major cannibalism.  Interestingly, because the men went out to hunt and cut wood, not a single child died, and only a few women died.

Yeah, the radiation thing was added later and is not noted in any of the official and direct documentation of the case. It's more then likely entirely pulled out of the ass of a conspiracy theorist that wants the case to revolve around UFO's somehow.

One of the other comments points to a book written by Poe that had a crew member on a ship that was eaten for the others survival... That crew was the "Donner party". Poe had some creepy real world foreshadowing going on!

The radiation part- first off you have it wrong, it was "high levels of radiation on their clothing".

I could find no other information, which is bullshit.  What TYPE of radiation, what radioisotope?? Well, actually Google had some talk saying beta radiation, but none of this is clearly sourced.

There was speculation that thorium camping lantern mantles (propane, kerosene, Coleman fuel lanterns) could have done that.  But thorium is alpha radiation.

Seriously, this big mystery yet you never identified the isotope?  Did you just throw the samples out after hearing a beta-sensitive Geiger counter tick?

What PART of the clothing?  It's important.  Shoes obviously suggest something.  Gloves, something else.  Pocket, something else there too.

They were also both triple-screw ships.

The novella stated that if Titan rammed an iceberg head-on, only the first three compartments would flood and the ship would remain afloat. Titanic was designed to survive having four flooded compartments. It is speculated that had Titanic rammed the iceberg, it would have survived.

Both ships were instead ripped open along their starboard sides, although for different reasons.

Furuta was: "A 16-year-old Japanese high school student who was abducted, tortured, raped, and murdered in the late 1980s. Her murder case was named the Concrete-encased high school girl murder case due to the state of her discovered body: in a concrete drum filled with over 50 
gallons of cement."

The added twist to that is that one of the main reasons as to why he died was that the fashion at the time was for extremely fitted suits. Because of this Ferdinand was sewn into his uniform. Whe he got shot, they couldn't get his uniform off of him in time to stop the bleeding.

>This moment of happenstance caused Central European powers to declare war on Serbia and what would become the allies of WWI

No... it gave *Austria-Hungary* an *excuse* to declare war on Serbia, something which the leadership had been itching to do for a while. This caused Russia to declare war on Austria, which caused Germany to declare war on Russia, etc... It wasn't a simply case of the two groups declaring war on each other. Italy was in the Central Powers but didn't support her allies and ended up fighting against Germany and Austria the next year.

Nope. They found that the only thing missing - the nine barrels of alcohol - could have set off an explosion that made no sound, but would have set off a shockwave that blew all the doors / windows open. The crew would have been scared out of their wits, probably thinking the ship was haunted, and jumped in the life raft without grabbing their stuff. They then floated away, presumably dying of thirst

Edit: a lot of people have patiently tried to explain that explosions / shockwaves *are* sound, and I'm sorry: I used the wrong word. The explosion was a pressure wave, which is an explosion that damages practically nothing and leaves cool air behind. I cannot speak for the absence of vapor-smell, as pointed out by /u/procrastinata, and as for the door, perhaps someone shut it for some reason as they exited. However, this is the theory that makes the most sense to me, and I am sticking to it.

The often poorly-sealed barrels of high proof alcohol were believed to have been evaporating in the heat, filling the ship with a highly flammable vapour which was, at best, dangerous to breathe in and, at worst, would have blown the ship up if there was a spark or flame.

It has been suggested that the crew discovered this emergency and, after opening all hatches and windows, got into a lifeboat and tied a rope to the ship, letting them follow at a safe distance until the dangerous vapours had dissipated. This was standard practice.

But if that rope broke, the crew would have been lost at sea, with no way to return to the ship.

I can explain it. Actually, I can just explain all of the reposts on reddit. 

Ready? Set? Go.

So one person posts, "Here is a picture of my banana." Everyone upvotes it and it becomes stupidly popular. Other people realize they want fake internet points. They also post, "Here is MY banana!" 

Now we have tons of banana posts. 

They die down, a week or two later some idiot finds a random post about a banana and thanks, "Wow, I bet no one saw this! I better post that shit." 

They post it, "Check out this banana!" The majority of Reddit has such a poor memory they don't fucking realize they just did this shit a week ago, so they all start posting bananas again. The cycle continues with literally EVERY POST. 


The questions or topics that get brought up? Only the most common questions that people ask are ever asked. So they get asked repeatedly. By the time a question is posted, answered, and then buried in reddit someone comes along and thinks, "Oh I didn't see this question, I should post it! No one has EVER asked what happens at cheerleader camp!"

Whoah there: There is no evidence yet that Tor is dead, cracked, or useless.

In the past Tor users have been discovered but every reported case so far stems from mistakes these people made while using it.

For example, a college student was *suspected* in some hacking incident and the FBI simply checked the school's network for Tor users, narrowed the list down to a few individuals, then the college student cracked under pressure.

If that student just kept silent they never would have been caught.

In the case of Dread Pirate Roberts the authorities merely watched and recorded every single post he made, narrowed down his profile, and connected the dots. In the thousands of posts he made there were descriptions of weather, certain locations, and other identifiable information.

So the lesson to be learned here is this: Spying on everyone at once doesn't solve any crime; real police work does.

There is only one real reason to spy on everyone at once: Power.

Operation Paperclip is a whole different load of creepy. 

One thing is - why didn't they want the UK (their greatest ally) to use the scientists.

Two - without it how would the next 20 - 50 years pan out? America wasn't great, Scientifically, at the time - it is likely the space race would have been a failure and Russia would emerge the world's largest power. What would happen then? How would Asia (China) do without a major rise of capitalism? 

Three - Was there, originally, something much more sinister behind this?

Bonus to this: America hadn't really cracked computing yet and the UK was much better suited to it. At the end of the war they basically took Computers from the UK and then asked them to not bother with them any more. If you know what I mean.

This "mystery" always appears but there never was any mystery at all.  They carved the name of the island they were going to in a nearby tree.  They were left for years without any support, couldn't cut it, and went to join the native tribe.  When their support party finally came, there was a storm coming in.  They arrived where the colony was supposed to be, saw Croaton carved into the tree trunk, realized the people of Roanoke had left to join the Croaton people, and decided that instead of continuing further in an oncoming storm to just turn around and go home.  The "native" people of the area had blue eyes, blond hair, and lighter skin in the coming generations, so it was pretty obvious assimilation had occurred.

Had to be assimilation, because they left the crown to begin a new life in the new world for a reason: religious freedom. Being the first ever permanent colony they likely were approached by the locals without caution. Once learning the culture of the natives, they deemed it better than the one they already knew. I mean makes sense really... peoples main purpose to coming to Americas was for freedom, and they chose to never be apart of the crown again - best way to do it: disappear.

I don't understand why this is touted as such a huge mystery. The colonists were left without supplies. They abandoned their colony, leaving behind a mysterious message - "Croatan," which suddenly becomes much less mysterious when you realize that that was the name of a nearby island. Which later mysteriously became inhabited by mixed-race Indians.

No, that's not creepy at all. They left a note saying they were moving to Croatoan Island and coincidentally later generations of the local Indian tribes started producing children that bore some markers that could only have come from cross breeding with colonists.

We may never have the specifics of exactly why things happened and in what time frame, but the general details are all quite clearly there to be seen.

> He graduated, but then turned in his degree only a couple years later, and moved to the woods where he lived for decades.

Except this part isn't true. Kaczynski graduated Harvard in 1962 and then went on to the University of Michigan and earned a PhD. He was one of the brightest students his professors at Michigan had ever seen. Kaczynski then became the youngest professor ever hired by the University of California and taught undergraduates in Berkeley.

**He did not move into the woods until ten years after he graduated from Harvard**, not "a couple." He accomplished more in that ten years than most people accomplish in a lifetime.

This is an overly simplistic and sensationalist connection between two events. 

The more likely scenario is that Kaczynski, who entered Harvard at the age of 16 as a mentally stable teenager, developed the first symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia at precisely the time of his life where that would be most likely--in his early twenties. At that point he moved into the woods and began to withdraw from society.

I would like to argue that we can't just say that because he participated in that he became like that.

A TL:DR of his Manifesto:

> Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times on April 24, 1995 and promised "to desist from terrorism" if the Times or the Washington Post published his manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future (also called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary to attract attention to the erosion of human freedom necessitated by modern technologies requiring large-scale organization.

I don't condone the violence, but he isn't wrong about our "erosion of human freedom".

Except that's not true. Hiroshima was home station of a few regional Army Headquarters and their equivalent of the Marine Corps was Headquartered there. Also the port served as a major shipping area.

Nagasaki wasnt even an original target. The United States planned on hitting the city of Kokura, but because of the heavy cloud cover, they had to change it to Nagasaki at basically the last minute. They decided on Nagasaki because of the major port it had.

Dresden was also of minimal military importance. It was utterly destroyed by fire-bombs mainly because it was already destined to fall to the USSR in a few weeks, and we wanted them to see first-hand what our strategic bomber fleet was capable of.

This is not entirely accurate. One of the sights was a backup because weather made it impossible to bomb the predetermined city. 

Other cities were not chosen because of historical and religious significance to the Japanese people. 

There was quite a lot of deliberation as to which city to bomb. Not just muscle flexing. 

The US knew the destructive power of the bombs and also the firebombs dropped on Tokyo caused more damage than the atomic bombs did.

There was a bit more to that, all Japanese cities were ranked dependant on several factors and had to have a lack of historical architecture (why Kyoto was ruled out) and a lack of leadership in order to ensure the people needed to effect the surrender were still alive (Tokyo ruled out), additionally the city had to be at least 3 miles wide in order to maximize the result. The remaining potential cities were Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Kokura, these were ranked dependant on how much of it was left undamaged from conventional bombing, how level it was, and lastly its military significance. 

The Los Alamos target committe chose Hiroshima first and Nagasaki as second because "Hiroshima is an important army depot and port of embarkation in the middle of an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and it is such a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target." Hiroshima was the headquarters of not only the 5th Division but the Japanese 2nd Army. The city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest sea ports in southern Japan and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials.

Not completely correct.  I'm not sure if it was Hiroshima or Nagasaki, but one of the two cities was picked specifically because the weather that day was not very good over the original target - Kyoto.  We would have bombed a city full of unmilitarized civilians, the "cultural capital" of Japan - to get a point across.  Instead we bombed another city without actualy military, because it was cloudy.  How arbitrary those hundreds of thousands of lives were that we decided to rain death on them because it was slightly more convenient than raining death on another city of innocents.

Hiroshima was picked because of this. Coincidentally enough, Nagasaki was chosen from a handful of fairly undamaged cities, because of those selecting it had visited before and thought it was a nice city. 

The other factor of course is we needed to show the Japanese and Russians how much damage the Nukes could do. Bombing an already bombed city doesn't help; so we bombed a less destroyed one.

It is a lie that the cities had little military potential as targets. Both represented important military targets due to the resources they had. In fact, the landmark used to target the atomic bomb (a distinctive H shaped bridge) was located right next to a major military base. However, it is true that the US did spare them and a couple other cities that were on a short list of potential targets from the fire-bombings that targeted Tokyo and other major Japanese cities in part to highlight how much damage the atomic bombs could do.

 Yeah, that disgusts me. Japan was also discussing surrender after the initial bombing, but the US wanted to see how their other bomb fared so they did it anyway. They also went to what should have been a "last resort" option far too quickly for a faction who claimed to protect the innocent. They didn't demonstrate the power of the nuke beforehand... and saying "prompt and utter destruction" is supposed to be adequate warning how? The people of that time would have thought "well that's war talk for ya", not "they've developed a weapon capable of unspeakable, ungodly horrors that will haunt us for generations". 

I am pretty much entirely opposed to the USA's use of the nuke in Japan, and especially opposed to them using it *twice*. Those were ordinary people like you and me who were murdered, and in their tens of thousands. Sure, Japan's leaders would likely have done the same if not worse, but that doesn't justify stooping that low. There were several options before dropping even the first nuke, and dropping the second was an unspeakable, disgusting war crime. Japan was already reeling and in the motions of surrender or inner revolt after the first... but as I said before, they wanted to see what kind of damage the other nuke (a different kind) was capable of. And they didn't need to observe first-hand. The mourning of the Japanese and subsequent articles, studies and pictures were more than enough for the results they wanted to see.

For science!

We were destroying cities overnight every other day. We were literally running out of cities to bomb. The Japanese didn't even care that we nuked them. They surrendered because Stalin invaded. But, blaming the bomb was in Japan's and America's best interests.

I really like the Silmarillion. Especially how you could interpret it as a 'history' of the world. The destruction of Numenor is kinda like the myth of Atlantis. Valinor would be sort of like Avalon.  Kind of. If you stretch it. When Morgoth destroys the two pillars you could kind of call that the flood...  whatever. I love LotR.

Not brand new; in fact, a large part of the US 'smart munitions' was reaching it's end of shelf life. Some say that that was the deciding factor behind the whole air-war bombing campaign; just clearing inventory.

It was a warehouse housing arms and military equipment used in the war effort. 

What happened:

>That the root of the failures in target location appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer in an effort to pinpoint the location of the FDSP (Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement) building at Bulevar Umetnosti 2. The officer used techniques known as "intersection" and "resection" which, while appropriate to locate distant or inaccessible points or objects, are inappropriate for use in aerial targeting as they provide only an approximate location. Using this process, the individual mistakenly determined that the building which we now know to be the Chinese Embassy was the FDSP headquarters.

In his mid 20's, Joseph Goebbels was going through a quarter life crisis as he was very unhappy working as a banker.

I'm a mid 20's banker who is also trying not to hate his life. The similarity between his own predicament and mine, really struck deep when I read Goebbels memoirs.

Yeah that's not true. He wanted to be a painter, yes, but he nect wanted to be an architect. Then he started looking around and discovered "the Jews were responsible for everything bad" type of thing. He hated a certain newspaper and it happened to be written and edited by Jews. He also didn't consider them German citizens and was appalled by the lack of Nationalism from what he considered German citizens.

I don't know why everyone feels like the US messed up by doing that. I highly doubt if the Japanese were to be sentenced to death (as they expected) they would willingly give up the information. When offered the choice of a pardon in exchange for the information they gave up the research.

That research has been proven valuable and at least in some weird way the people who were murdered and tortured didn't die for nothing (as if they were murdered and tortured and nothing came of it).

What's done was done and nothing the US or any other nation could have done was going to take back the damage and loss of human life.

That's not a picture of 1918, the uniforms are wrong. Specifically, nobody's wearing a steel helmet, so it must be pre-1916, probably during the retreat in late 1914. I'd be able to tell more if the resolution was better.

Edit: Found a [better pic](http://www.leamingtonhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Tandey-3-Painting.jpg). Yeah, no way that's 1918. This is a picture of Henry Tandey carrying a wounded comrade on 22 October 1914. The man being carried is not Hitler, and it's not of the Hitler incident, which took place four years later. As for the incident itself: 

>[The military historian David Johnson has researched the incident in great depth for his book ‘One Soldier & Hitler 1918′ and has concluded that no part of it could be proved to have taken place.](http://www.leamingtonhistory.co.uk/?p=1704)

Yeah, it's never been proven that Adolf Hitler was the man that Tandey saw.

Also, the painting isn't of Hitler, it's of Tandey helping wounded allies. Why would he be carrying Hitler? He let him walk by.

**Ursula and Sabina Eriksson**, born 1967, are a pair of Swedish twins who came to national attention in the United Kingdom in 2008 after an apparent episode of folie à deux which resulted in unique footage of insanity on the M6 motorway and the killing of Glenn Hollinshead. No drugs or alcohol were involved in any of the incidents. Their actions have never been explained, other than by a rare, induced delusional disorder which caused the pair to be temporarily insane.

Once I (no shit. this is legit) saw a UFO. I called my mom over and her jaw dropped. We kept watching. It changed it's angle- it was a plane. This actually happened. Planes apparently look like scifi UFO's from certain angles.

For anybody looking at this there is the book of the same name by Iris Chang. The author committed suicide years later as a result from the intense backlash of the Japanese government but mostly the psychological damage she suffered from the research she did.

**Linda Hazzard** (born 1867 in Carver County, Minnesota, died of self-starvation in 1938) was a fiery orator and doctor, who was implicitly killing her patients by exhausting diets.

You might be interested in a book called "Missing 411". It's about very weird & unexplained disappearances from various state parks. Apparently, it happens more often than one would think. I haven't read it, but heard an interview with the author and it was incredibly interesting.

Nothing but legitimate missing person's cases.  Some of them are pretty chilling too, and very unfortunate.  

One of the more recent solved ones was where 3 people disappeared.  I'm paraphrasing here, but if i recall correctly, it turned out the car they were in slid off the road into a body of water deep enough to conceal it for 25+ years.  Their bodies were still inside.

I Think I attempted to debunk this when I saw a different comment relating to this. I'll put my debunk comment right here.

> Most likely caused by lots of snow. Huge amounts of snow may have fallen on the tent, trapping them, so they cut their way out of it and tried to set up a new camp by a cedar tree.

> 6 of them died of hypothermia while there, others had fallen into a ravine and a small avalanche fell down onto them, and the woman missing her tongue and eyes most have lost them to a scavenging animal while the ones with heavy injuries (skull and rib fractures) had received them from the avalanche.

> The radiation on the clothes may have come from the nuclear testing grounds near the camp or the random areas of radioactivity that were mentioned somewhere else in this post.

> Case closed.

And that's that.

Well, they didn't "inject negroes with syphilis", they just didn't treat the patients that tested positive for the disease, or inform them that they were infected which allowed the disease to spread rapidly throughout the entire community. 

And the IRB isn't the only positive to come out of the experience (and also Tuskeegee wasn't the precise impetus for IRBs anyway). As horrible as the experiment was, it provided truly invaluable information on the progression and pathophysiology of neurological syphilis. 

Unethical experiments are kind of a double edged sword. For example, Joseph Mengele performed truly horrific experiments on concentration camp prisoners, most significant being his experiments into hypothermia. While the experiments were brutal, basically freezing people to death and other horrible variations, without those experiments our knowledge of the pathophysiology of hypothermia would likely still not be where it currently is with them. Similarly, the Japanese Unit 731 did significant study on evisceration and performed live dissections without anesthesia, but those records provided incredible insight into the inner workings of internal organs that likely would have been impossible to obtained Prior to the creation of CT-scanners and MRIs.

I would never say those experiments were good in any way, not justify those atrocities, but many people forget that they were performed with valid scientific goals and did advance the understanding of their target concepts.

A little clarification: the physicians did not inject the patients with syphilis but lied about giving them a treatment or withheld treatment deliberately. They knowingly lied to their patients that there was a cure available and allowed syphilis to be passed to wives and unborn children. Heinous and unforgivable but they didn't actively inject syphilis into the patients. It's shocking and terrible how long that experiment went on - even the backlash when it was exposed.

With all the accidents, lost weaponry, and false-attack alarms, it's just lucky we survived the Cold War. In many cases, it was one person or one small piece of equipment that prevented all-out nuclear war.

> so good. Now, instead of using a symbol that is connected to the live of your religious leader (e.g. a carpenter’s tool) this torture and execution device becomes the predominant symbol and it is put on everything: your temp

Well the idea is that it was a self-sacrifice for our redemption... The nuance is that He accepted the cross willingly for us. Its a symbol of the sacrifice He made. Jesus is not a religious leader. Jesus is God for Christians. That is a slight difference I would say.

**Jonestown** was the informal name for the **Peoples Temple Agricultural Project**, an intentional community in northwestern Guyana formed by the Peoples Temple led by Jim Jones. It became internationally notorious when, on November 18, 1978, 918 people died in the settlement as well as in a nearby airstrip and in Georgetown, Guyana's capital. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations.

My daughter is going to the holocaust museum and memorial in Washington DC later this year with school. That's some serious human rights shit... The stuff she has to learn about as a prerequisite to going is rather amazing. They need to read about it all, and watch movies and documentaries. It's all being run by the Jewish University here. Some amazing stuff, all for a 13 year old to take in...

Yeah, but he did not personally do these things to these individuals, those who followed him did it. Put yourself in the shoes of a possible victim you do not fear the man giving the order when directly confronted with such a situation you essentially fear the man actually doing the deed. Perspective plays an imperative role in what the consensus of creepy or fucked up is, one man controlling others to do his bidding is really nothing new, however the man who does the bidding...

America enslaved anyone who wasn't completely British. If you were German, French, Italian, it didn't matter. No matter what race anyone was, people were denied rights.

The assumption that all white people laugh at the idea of slavery is racist as well. It doesn't matter what color you are. If you are making ridiculous, blatant assumptions about a person purely because of their skin colt, that is racist

Lemay also wanted to 'unleash hell' on the Soviet Union during the Cuban Crisis. Afterward he always considered it Americans biggest mistake. The estimate death toll for SIOP (the US nuclear attack plan) was 600 million people (that's 600 holocausts), and that was just First Strike. A Soviet retalliation strike would have produced a few hundred million more - plus those would were bound to perish in the ensuing chaos. In short, Lemay was willing to annihilate our entire civilization to prove a point...

That's easy to explain. They were able to make it to Croatoan Island (hence the writing carved in a tree) and assimilated into local peoples. That explains a burst of fair-skinned natives, some with blue eyes.

**Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed** (Báthory Erzsébet in Hungarian, Alžbeta Bátoriová in Slovak; 7 August 1560 – 21 August 1614) was a countess from the renowned Báthory family of Hungarian nobility. Although in modern times she has been labeled the most prolific female serial killer in history, the number of murders and even her guilt is debated. She is nevertheless remembered as the "Blood Countess."

I am also intrigued by the Dyatlov Pass Incident since I read about it a few years back.  I recently watched the fictional movie based on it; "Devils Pass" which covered all of the factual aspects of it, but branched off on a horror movie aspect toward the end. Cheesy but not overly bad. You might like it.

I'm surprised it wasn't more. Basically, when the USSR collapsed, the government gave up and the military was left to its own devices. This includes all the remote military launch sites. And so enterprising Russian officers, all of whom never experienced life outside the USSR, suddenly had *lots* of interested parties willing to pay them $$$$$$$ for their nukes. They didn't care, they took the cash and sold their stock!

I think what you're referring to is Jonestown, which was more murder than suicide. Many people willingly drank the flavor-aid (/u/halfrussian is right about that, not kool aid) but there was evidence that many were shot or injected with something (probably because they resisted committing suicide).

The phenomenon of the **female homicides in Ciudad Juárez**, called in Spanish the **feminicidios** ("femicides") and **las muertas de Juárez** ("The dead women of Juárez"), involves the violent deaths of hundreds of women since 1993 in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a border city across the Rio Grande from the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. The estimated homicide toll is speculated to be around 400, but many local residents believe that the true count of los feminicidios stands at an estimated 5,000 victims. Most of the cases remained unsolved as of 2003, and are still mainly unsolved today.

**R v Dudley and Stephens** [1884] 14 QBD 273 DC is a leading English criminal case that established a precedent, throughout the common law world, that necessity is no defense against a charge of murder. It concerned survival cannibalism following a shipwreck and its purported justification on the basis of a Custom of the Sea. It marked the culmination of a long history of attempts by the law, in the face of public opinion sympathetic to castaways, to outlaw the custom and it became something of a cause célèbre in Victorian Britain.

what an interesting fabricated lie you've posted here, with an utter disregard for history and truth. why don't you post some evidence here for any of your claims other than the linguistic root of the word morphine, you misinformation peddling imbecile?


since you will never, ever do that: In 1895, the German drug company Bayer marketed diacetylmorphine as an over-the-counter drug under the trademark name Heroin.

Bullshit, everybody knows Hendrix became tupac until that identity was discovered, then he hid as Michael Jackson (remember when his face couldn't be seen!?) until Jackson decided that it was bad for his fame, so he set up the fake on child abuse cases. After that it gets a bit hazy, but Morgan Freeman is clearly not tupac.

Just so I understand better, are you talking about removing limbs and reattaching them so that they're still functional? Or just removing the limbs in general?

Because from my understanding, she was just removing the limbs and stitching them back onto the body in some insane way. It seems like that would be way more doable as long as the slave didn't die during the amputation.

at the end of the sequel book to silence of the lambs (forgot its name, I think it was just 'Hannibal Lecter'), 

**[Spoiler](#s "Hannibal capture Kendler (the asshat boss of Clarice), and invites Clarice over. Clarice comes over. Kendler is tied to a chair near a dinner table, with the upper part of his skull cut out, while conscious. Hannibal invites Clarice to the dinner table, near which there is a cooking station. Hannibal proceed to take a spoon of Kendler's brain, frying it in front of him, and serving it to himself, Clarice, and Kendler. Yes, he feeds him his own brain. later Clarice and Lecter move to Argentina and live happily ever after.")**

TL;DR: Hannibal is something special.

>You think Darth Vader and Hannibal Lecter are bad guys until you start reading about real people.

no.

edit: book's name is 'Hannibal', great book, not as good as 'Silence of the Lambs' though IMO.

I think that's a far stretch. At the time, this was a new procedure, but it was thought highly promising. In a social time where there were far less options for those who were mentally handicapped, the thought that this new brain procedure could *cure* them is pretty tantalizing for a parent of a disabled child. We know now that lobotomy is not a viable option, but we didn't then. This Wikipedia article demonizes Kennedy Sr. quite a bit for this choice, but if a trained medical professional told me there was a procedure that would help my disabled child, I can't say that I wouldn't try it. The only reason we frown upon this now is because the outcome was poor; if it had been a success, we would consider Kennedy's choice a gutsy triumph.

I think it's interesting they say the mind of a two year old but that she was nonverbal. My son's two and nonverbal, but that's because he's autistic. Two year olds are capable of a surprising amount of complexity. I wonder how accurate or generous that description of her is. It was interesting reading about the activities they would do with her and using my son to understand better how that probably went. Then my daughter is about the age she was mentally before surgery, so looking at them both and that juxtaposition has been very interesting for me. I would say as far as the "lightbulb" goes, the difference isn't as vast as one might think. Personality develops long before academic ability. The trouble would be in the sudden inability to understand the world around you. With that in mind, making her world objectively smaller was a kindness, really. Although in all this I've conveniently forgotten the fact that personality is largely seated in the frontal lobe- the same place her surgeons whipped up some mushroom soup. 

You know what, though? I'm sick and I think the cough syrup is making me loopy. I'm leaving this comment, but I'll probably be embarrassed about it later. C'est la vie.

Consent?  What kind of consent would a mentally handicapped girl be able to give?

Rosemary Kennedy's behavior prior to the lobotomy is well documented as being pretty fucking terrible for the time.  Like "crashing a dinner party to masturbate frantically in front of the Kennedy's guests" kind of terrible.

What was done to her was horrible, but in no way was Rosemary a coherent adult.  As she aged she regressed to, for lack of a better phrase pre-coffee, "full retard", and lobotomy was the answer to this in the early 20th century.

According to wikipedia, Armin Meiwes (the cannibal in question), was by profession an IT repair technician.
I'd be very surprised if that wasn't a deliberate reference in the episode.

I don't know if "enjoyed" is the right word here. "Meiwes amputated Brandes' penis and the two men attempted to eat the penis together before Brandes was killed. Brandes had insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work and ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes' penis. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw, but could not because it was too tough and, as he put it, "chewy". Meiwes then fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic; he then fried it with some of Brandes' fat but by then it was too burned to be consumed. He then chopped it up into chunks and fed it to his dog." - From Wikipedia. Maybe they "attempted to enjoy" it, but it sounds like poor preparation ruined the meal. Edit: Forgot to add that yes, I totally agree with you: that is the best, most interesting, bizarre part.

That's what I can't wrap my head around. His sexual satisfaction involves being eaten and DYING. I understand that is a once-in-a-lifetime thrill (pun sort of intended because it is literally true) but surely the sexual pleasure you gain isn't worth your life?

My pessimistic guess is that a film would focus mainly, if not wholly, on the Holmes murders.

Part of what was so wonderful about that book was the contrast between the the thread about Holmes, and the thread about the World's Fair. They contrasted wonderfully without jarring, but I don't see how they could fit both into a film.

A TV series might work better.

YES! Finally! A movie is being made from a book that I read before hearing about the movie! So this is what it feels like to be a movie/book hipster? I'm usually behind the curve on these things.

Hunger Games? Movie had already been announced.

The Hunt for Red October? I was YEARS behind on that one.

Patriot Games? Same story.

The Sum of All Fears? I started reading when I heard about the movie, only got about halfway, watched the movie, then abandoned it. Both were meh.

DaVinci Code? Movie was weeks from opening, but I still finished it before watching. Book was WAY better, btw.

October Sky? Read the book in school, but the movie had already been out for a while.

The Phantom Menace? Obviously the book was written after the movies were announced. Not sure which was better. Probably the movie because you don't have to spend weeks on it.

Eragon. I enjoyed the first book, despite it obviously being written by a teenager (which I started reading when I heard about the movie being made), but when I heard the reviews of the movie I lost interest in both. Never saw it, didn't continue the series.

Before anyone asks I've never read any of LotR or Potter, and don't have much interest. Hopefully one day they'll make a movie out of Without Remorse or Red Storm Rising. I guess there's hope if Shadow Recruit does well.

Oh man, this is a terrible idea, there is WAY too much going on in that book to be squeezed into a 2-3 hour movie.  Yeah it was half about Holmes and how fucked up he was, but the parts about Burnham and the worlds fair is incredibly interesting (more interesting then Holmes IMO) and I feel it would get tossed to the wayside in favor of watching Holmes stalk his victims through Chicago.

Quite possibly the best book I've ever had to read for a class.  The class was American Urban History, and out teacher made us read it because (along with H.H. Holmes), it focused on one of the architects of the 1893 Worlds Fair in Chicago. Indeed, a fantastic book. If I remember correctly, didn't Holmes sell the skeletons to medical students?

Not precisely. Serial killers leave considerable gaps between killings. The first recorded serial killer was a Roman woman named [Locusta of Gaul](http://herodotuswept.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/the-first-serial-killer-locusta-of-gaul/).

While her kill streak is less impressive, the circumstances are far more shocking. She had a freaking following, and servants.

I had to write a paper about this in middle school, too.

Anyway, my point is...I've forgotten most of that stuff, but these horrific tests still stick with me.

In middle school (the seventh grade) I too did a project based on Josef Mengele. Researching for hours on end was disgusting because of the things I was learning, butIi kept at it because it was interesting. The worst part was that I had to present it to 4 other grade 7 classes. Everyone left the class in shock because of my explaining on what Josef did to his 'patients'.

not surprising, just think about it for a moment. Pretend your bother is kind of a screw up and has a criminal record but needed a job. Most employers wouldn't even think about hiring him but you being family might decide to give him a chance because of your personal relationship with him. 

The point I'm trying to make is that people don't treat everyone as equals, you care about friends and family but a random stranger you have never met is a lot harder to care about.

His behavior isn't all that surprising to me. He saw his colleague as a human, but not his victims. They did a study recently and found that people view the homeless and destitute as things rather than people in terms of regions of brain activity.

Goering was the same way, he helped a few Jewish friends he had escape the country,  his brother actually helped hundreds, and Goering was responsibly protective of his brother. He didn't seem to be hateful,  more vain, blindly ambitious,  and able to justify nearly anything to himself in the name of that.

This idea is greatly portrayed in one of the Dr. Who episodes when ~~David Tennant~~ Christopher Eccleston was still the doctor (as billie piper the companion, so somewhere around season 1 or 2ish). In this episode, an green alien (called Raxacoricofallapatorians) asks the doctor to spare her because she spared a human earlier that week when she would've usually killed her. Eccleston retorts by saying that "compassion towards one individual does not satisfy the millions [you've] killed". Yes of course their act of compassion is unexpected. However, they've still committed horrible acts of murder and are/have expected to cleanse their guilt through showing compassion to one individual. Other great examples would be Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld in the pianist where he saves Władysław Szpilman (the main character and pianist) during the holocaust by providing him warmth and food. Hitler could've also showed signs of compassion towards some people; however, his crimes far outweigh any sort of benign acts he performed.  
  
All in all, it's not surprising that humans show unexpected signs of compassion; those that do while having committed horrible deeds are more so exercising their power by showing compassion (as Schindler in Schindler's list pointed out to Amon Goeth). Others try to cure their guilt by doing good which obviously is futile.  
  
EDIT: as lol_squared pointed out it was eccleston as the doctor rather than david tennant

I'd say that the level of humanity is both scary and not scary. Scary in that it wasn't just pure craziness going on, less scary since that means people like Mengele really lived for the science. You have to realize that the doctors often did not think of these people as people. The propaganda called the Jews rats: if you was a doctor you would likely have no problem cutting up rats. Thus, if you were a doctor and essentially believed in such propaganda, cutting up people would not be much different. In their mind, they weren't evil: they did the right thing. It's like when you're eating meat for example, you don't consider yourself evil for that.

I never really saw Josef Mengele as a Nazi. I saw him more as a doctor who worked for the Nazis because they both had a common goal: research. Yes, he did some fucked up stuff that nobody could ever be okay with (I hope), but he didn't do it because he hated Jews, he did it for science. I don't know if that makes him better or worse, but, somehow it matters to me.

Also because a lot of people confuse "Mendel" and "Mengele" and I was called a Nazi in high school when learning about him.

Just as Adolf Hitler allowed for many immunities and even attempted to have his homosexual mentor (from the Nazi Party) sentenced to a jail term instead of death. The doctor that cared for his mother, a jewish man, was granted immunity to the country of his choosing and was given pass after he had failed to evacuate Germany prior. If you read many of the bios on high profile nazi members you'll be shocked as to what they might have been like as human beings apart from their nazi-esque images. Hitler for example, looked like a hard working young man that sacrificed so much of his life to care for his sick and widowed mother, raise his orphaned siblings or, at minimum, support them...and then he traveled throughout the new German state and the surrounding territories, looking for work and experience, even living amongst the Jewish community in Vienna - growing to appreciate them and their efforts to support their community and rise out of the poverty that many in the city had succumbed to. He began to become passionate about politics and what life ought to be like in order to help the working peoples of nations....soon after he began to grow as a human being WW1 rolls around and he jumps into a Bavarian unit and spends some miserable time in the trenches of Western Europe. He gets back to Germany, a shaken but unchanged man, and is then recruited by a government agency to audit new political parties and groups that are gaining momentum in Germany. One such group he was auditing was spewing so much rhetoric and disgusting philosophy around that he began to rush out of the room angrily, and when stopped and chastised by an official of the group for looking so bitter, he passionately tore into him. Later, the head officials of this group began to contact him and actively pursue such a charismatic and passionate man for the face of the movement...they found him, and worked with him, slowly undermining all of the personal and progressive gains that he had made as a person through out his experiences in life. He did a complete 180 on his philosophies on Nationalism, what he once thought to be a poison, on religion, what he once thought to be the worst weapon the leaders of society could use to undermine the working class [when institutionalized], and began to absolutely abhor the community that had accepted him and helped him through his struggles when he was starving in Vienna...he saw them as a poison that was undermining true Germanic peoples...not as an example that they should follow...but a faction that was only organized and so well put together because they did not truly belong to Germany and thus did not endure her pains. The story is quite sad really, as the rest is history...

But sometimes, if you look at some of his actions throughout his campaign, beneath his terrible actions, you will see glimmers of the young man that once appeared to be the face of a new, great, progressive Germany...the embodiment of something great to come. Sadly, power corrupts even the greatest of character at times, and desperate men, that once stood naked before the world battling all she threw at them, turn their faces to integrity and loyalty for a new destiny. He absolutely sold his soul and surrendered his individuality because he was sick and tired and saw a way out of his struggle for his friends and family...an easy way. But again, it's just terrifying and depressing to see what he might have tried to do under the radar of his regime...that that young man, that brilliant child, and passionate warrior for a greater humanity was still fighting to gain a foothold on the demon that consumed his mind and body. 

None of this condones what Hitler did...from attempting to destroy an entire people to plunging a world entire war and seeing father's grieve the deaths of their sons, when he was once convinced that the case should always be opposite. It does not mean that he needs the respect of people for who he had been, prior to who he became...in fact the opposite must be true as she showed himself to have no integrity when a decision over his soul came down to a choice at the margin. The case is simply a tragedy, and a reminder to all people, now and again, that we must reign true to our convictions no matter what, as wavering on them, and acting blindly in one direction or the other, might result in catastrophe...that forgoing the rights of other human beings and training yourself to hate their very nature might only lead to bloodlust. If you give into power entirely, whether it be politics, religion, money, or other status...you have become a fool...you can no longer change the world...or at least not for the better. 


It sucks, but it is a great reminder, and a sad and horrible tale that is quite true and horrific.

Mengele himself told his son after the war that he saved lives and never killed anyone.  Not a single document of an experiment of his exists.   The nazis did plenty of experiments that survived the war, but not by him.  

Either because he did not do any experiments or because they did not survive the war.  

Due to the bizarre nature of the eyewitnesses, such as changing their eye color, And not a shred of any documentary proof, idon't believe he did any.

Hubertus Strughold, a scientist brought to the US as part of Operation Paperclip who was involved in human experimentation with the Nazi's?

It's hard and cold utilitarianism. We can either put these hundred people in jail for life and burn the place down or we can at least get something out of all this mess and use their research. We can never, *ever* repeat anything that has been done in this place so this information could potentially be lost forever if we don't take it.

Unlike the Nazi experimentation, the Japanese actually kept extensive records of their experiments. There's no reason *not* to use this information and this people once the act was committed. 

Burning the info and arresting them won't bring all the dead back from the grave. It would be a waste.

Would you have rather all those people die in vain? I say, at least we got the data out of those experiments, which makes it more likely that we'll never repeat those ever again.

OP's point wasn't to discredit the atrocities Japan also committed, but to point out that they were able to use rats instead of cutting up humans without anesthesia, in relation to one experiment. I don't think pointing out what Japan did besides the rat usage needed to be brought up, people know that they wear nowhere near spotless.

The plan was for him to appear as the victim. He thought the police would let him get the money to the others, who would escape, after which he would get the bomb removed. He didn't know that the other two wanted him dead and had shortened the timer on the bomb. They were hoping for a two-fer.

I think it's both. The idea of Kehoe blithely going through the motions of his day-to-day life every day for nine months like nothing was wrong is deeply unnerving to me, as are his absolute glee at the success of his plan and the deliberate, methodical sort of spite with which he set about destroying everything at his farm.

He chose the day that he did for the bomb because it was the last day of school before summer break, and according to some of the surviving children, he had walked around the school the day before the disaster, jokingly reminding them that they "only had one day left".

Even as recently as a few years ago, people were reluctant to do anything on the ground where his farm had stood, out of fear that he had buried caches of explosives in the hope of doing even more damage from beyond the grave.

Willie Pickton and Clifford Olsen were both from Port Coquitlam, a suburb of Vancouver. 

One a notorious serial killer of Vancouver sex trade workers from the downtown East side. He was convicted of 7 murders. The creepy part is how he disposed of the bodies. He fed them to his pigs, which caused a massive scare in Vancouver as he sold his pigs to be sold to Safeway grocery chains. 

Clifford Olsen was a convicted child murderer. I don't know much of his story. I know the cop who apprehended him and he says he still can't sleep because he looked evil in the eye.

More that the humans who were not ultra smart (for the time) nor cooperative basically had no chance, and those that had those traits survived and eventually thrived. It was a cull of humans in epic proportions. Everyone alive today shares genes with the 1,000-10,000 breeding pairs that survived that event, and while we did go on to become the dominant form because of those traits, I don't think that was guaranteed by it.

How did it make us dominant/lead to it? Were there other species better than us? Do we have proof of them? I wonder what would have happened hadn't the Toba Catastrophe happened.

According to wikipedia neither our cousins(homo florensis, homo neanderthalis, homo erectus, homo habilis) were extinct during that period.

Homo Florensis:http: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis

homo neanderthalis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal

homo erectus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus

Homo Habilis : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis

Of course there are other kind of animals than "humans". Just saying that these weren't the ones that were completely removed by the Toba catastrophe.

I would question that we *are* the dominant form of life. Insects exist on all continents (except Antarctica) and can survive in conditions we can't. They also outnumber us greatly. They will survive long after we're dead.

Humans can outrace any walking creature over long distances, due to our cold hairless bodies and bizarre but efficient upright stance. We're sociopathic, cruel, smart, creative, and unrelenting, using every natural power of Nature and unnatural artifice of our own design to relentlessly hunt prey when we're not destroying each other.

Humans are the White Walkers of real life, and we came out of the long winter to conquer all of planet Earth.

in this day and age of early-warning systems, i'd assume we'd have advanced notice and a series of controlled explosions would be used to suppress the destructive impact by releasing the pressure over time.

Most people that drown in cold water don't have any water in their lungs.  We have a reflex called the mammalian diving reflex that more or less closes our airway to the lungs when your face is submerged in cold water.  That feeling you get in your throat when you go into cold water?  That's it.  If you don't surface and get your face out of the cold water, your throat won't reopen.  You'll die and your throat will remain closed.  If you die and then get thrown in cold water, there will be water in your lungs.

You can drown and have no water in your lungs, it's called 'dry drowning'. Official cause of death was a bullet to the head. According to the autopsy there was alcohol in his system, no water found in his lungs and no poison in his system. It's believed he never consumed the poisoned food but they wanted to seem like heroes for slaying this monster who could survive poison and being shot so many times. So they greatly exaggerated his death in their statements.

Actually evidence that the assassination was at least organized by British operatives. Rasputin was gaining power and was an outspoken advocate for peace and lover of Germany. At best England would lose an ally in WWI, at worst he would lead Russia onto the side of Germany. The entire supernatural story/changing events are because Rasputin was tortured/interrogated and the men responsible were covering it up to make themselves look better.

Thanks for bringing up that detail; I was always fascinated by the Rasputin story, but despite my disappointment in the story not being as shocking as initially presented, I'd rather know the truth than be delighted by the myth.

That said, I just looked at his wikipedia entry, and it's now suggested he didn't actually eat anything due to an aversion to sugar.  He also likely died from a bullet wound to the head early in the assassination, and that the water in the lungs thing isn't particularly significant.  It's tough to say; the main account of the murder was clearly embellished by the perpetrators, and considering how hard it is *now* to get a straight story out of Russia, I imagine people will continue to speculate as to what happened for years to come.  To some extent, I'm now more fascinated by the uncertainty...

I'm sure you would have been fine if you were born in another time period :). The majority of the most gruesome methods were reserved for the absolute most heinous of criminals (a serial murderer, rapist, or someone who really pissed off the monarch). Drawing and quartering, for example, was a particularly serious punishment as the end result was devoid of a proper burial. Back then, being buried without everything intact meant the individual could not be granted salvation. The state withholding someone's afterlife wasn't used willy nilly, most people would rarely witness these punishments let alone suffer them.

Haha I'm very sorry for introducing this to you. Where did you read about the cool air and screaming? The brazen bull wasn't often used and has reached a certain myth status so I'm rather wary of any sensationalist material. My research books aren't with me, so I would love to read what you found.

Never understood iron maiden for torture, it would kill too fast. But the concept might come from another method. Where you were stuffed in a barrel, they'd drive some nails in it, and roll you down a hill.

There are so many of these stories. Some ship or plane was in the middle of the ocean and then lost contact and was never seen again. "OMG where did it go?" Into the fucking ocean. If a plane of boat "disappears" that just means we don't know exactly what part of the ocean has the corpses. *Occasionally* we're unsure of what dense jungle has the corpses. 

The fuck did you think happened? They found the bridge to Cybertron and are partying it up with Optimus? If a plane doesn't come into an airport, what the fuck do you think is gonna happen? What is mysterious about "sometimes things crash"?

I've seen a few psychotic breaks. Her reactions look like one. And a lot of people say that she was acting fine shortly before, but I've also read articles that said that she was acting weird and felt that someone was following her. So, paranoia, impending psychotic episode (which can come out of nowhere), combined with an electrical glitch in the elevator...full blown psychotic episode.

I read about this in a different post.  But they were talking about her hitting the Open butten repeatedly, hence the door staying open so long.  Something about her having terrible eye sight and not wearing her glasses, and why she bends over and hits all the buttons (not sure which floor is hers).

It looked to me like she was playing hide and seek or something. Maybe she fucked up the elevator by pressing all the buttons, which is why it stayed open. It looked like she was playfully hiding in the elevator, and was waiting for a friend to come running around a corner or something.

Then perhaps she saw whoever she was playing with, and was telling them the elevator wasn't closing or working.

I don't know, I don't think it's anything supernatural. Playing hide and seek, or just playfully hiding from someone seems more reasonable. It could explain how she ended up on the roof in the water supply. Trying to hide, accidentally fell in a drowned? I don't know details, just trying think of a logical explanation because it seems the internet has taken this thing to another level of supernatural conspiracy.

Someone came up with a pretty good theory about her losing her glasses, mashing buttons on a certain row to try and get to her own floor, then being confused when she hits the button to keep the elevator open and trying to signal for someone outside the elevator, but there isn't anyone to help her. So then she gives up and leaves. It made perfect sense and explained the whole elevator thing.

If you like I can try and find the comment I'm talking about. If I can't find it I will watch through the video again and try to explain each thing that happens from memory.

No idea about her actual death though.

Explain this:

Elevator door takes about 6 seconds to go from open to closed as evidence from the video. I understand that shes hopping in and out a lot but there are plenty of intervals where it should have closed. I have no answer for that, everything else has an answer but that. My best explanation, not involving something supernatural, the person that killed her(or a just someone in general) is standing outside pushing the call button over and over again.

Actaully, though you make a good point, there is a high chance she was on LSD or another halucinogen, as they tend to pass through and out of the body after 3-5 days, she was found two weeks later, and the way she acts is extremely similar to someone having a bad trip. Again though, you make a good point, i just wanted to add perspective.

Tell me about it. I went to the comments on that original link after reading it, hoping for some more info, and it's just a bunch of people completely devaluing her life and acting as if she was born and bred to participate in some demonic ritual. It's disgusting.

I tried looking for more info elsewhere but kept running into the same problem as you. Then I looked on Reddit some more and found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1p15j2/the_mysterious_case_of_elisa_lam/) thread. It seems to be the best source for information based in reality. The more I read, the more it seems like she was suffering from some kind of mental disorder/issues that led to her odd behavior and death.

Was it debunked that it wasn't hers or does it just have to do with the recent Tumblr updates? Just curious, I'm just hearing about this case through this thread and I found it very interesting. Looking around, her Tumblr is the only thing still being updated. If you look at [this](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/autre) link and go to her other online profiles, none of them have been updated since her death, and her twitter is deleted. Another Reddit thread linked her [Instagram](http://instagram.com/moulesmariniere), which hasn't been updated either and has a few comments mentioning her death (of course, they could have been posted by random people thinking it was her profile too).

Since the Tumblr is linked to other online accounts that share the same/similar usernames haven't been updated, it does *seem* to be hers. It is weird that it's been updated, though. Since there's only been a handful of posts since February, Euron_Greyjoy's explanation about queuing posts sounds the most plausible. And if you consider that she was supposed to be traveling and probably not updating her blog much, it makes sense that February would have the most amount of queued posts. A couple of the newer posts are of a model named Elisa too, who she had blogged pictures of previously. It wouldn't be too strange for her to have some more in queue. The only other thing I can think of is that Tumblr users can re-use usernames of deleted blogs, however, I don't think that's the case here as her entire archive would be gone as well.

... As I typed this up I noticed a couple other things. Her [March 2011 archive](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/archive/2011/3) has some photographs that seem to be the owner of the Tumblr. [This](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/3618147883) one would probably be best for comparison as it shows her face, although if it was her, it's a couple years old, and is impossible to compare to the video at least. There is also a [blog post](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/41786151020/i-have-arrived-in-laland-and-there-is-a) about her being in LA. The more I look through the blog, the more I think you weren't wrong in saying that is was hers.

ETA - Okay, now I'm almost positive the most recent posts were queued. If you look at who she reblogged them from, they were posted before her death. For example, [this](http://nouvelle-nouveau.tumblr.com/post/46831796200/confusedtree-flightfoot-is-this-a-zelda) video was reblogged from "lampfaced," who posted it on January 13, 2013. The most recent post with the lighbulb was reblogged from [here](http://berezy.tumblr.com/post/40385454895/skeletales-by-alessandro-gottardo), which says it was posted "11 mois" ago. Also, it makes sense that she would queue a snowy scene with a Christmas tree to post in December. I would try to go through more of the posts to see when they date back to but the blog is loading incredibly slow for me for some reason.

Bipolar disorder doesn't cause anything like this behavior.  Happy --> sad --> happy --> sad OR happy --> mad --> happy --> mad, with periods of days to weeks between each end of the cycle.  

That's it.  That's all bipolar disorder does.  Well, basically.  If it can be attributed to happy/sad or happy/mad, then it's a behavior that can fit.

I remember a story about a woman in Germany who went to buy a loaf of bread. She got a whole shopping cart full of money and went to get the bread. She forgot something and left the shopping cart on the streat to retrieve it. When she got back the shopping cart was gone, but the money was still there. That's how bad Germany's inflation was at the time.

It's possible if it were a frantic soldier crazed from combat or shell shock or PTSD, but most normal people wouldn't be able to just slay an entire family one by one with a melee weapon just to stay alive.  Most (sane) people would resort to theft at first, possibly killing one and grabbing/running.

You need to read the entire story. Though you are probably in the ballpark, there are certain eerie aspects to the story. Like for one the former maid quitting because she thought the place was haunted. The other maid had only worked their for one day at the time she was killed. Other weird things were they found footprints leading to the house , but not away. Beyond that the killer lived in the house for several days afterwards.

A [mattock](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattock) is a versatile hand tool, used for digging and chopping, similar to the pickaxe. It has a long handle, and a stout head, which combines an axe blade and an adze (cutter mattock) or a pick and an adze (pick mattock).

It's not simply that 4 people were killed in a farm.

It's that someone may have been living in their home doing things that they weren't aware of, someone may have stalked them for days, it's the eerie imagery of seeing the footprints in the snow, etc.

You most likely haven't heard of this because the medical profession likes to hide a lot of its past mistakes for example, antidepressant when they first came out were very unstable and made people very anxious and even caused other psychological problems (can't remember the name) but it made people want scratch off their own skin and get out of their body but a board overruled a decision to stop this drug because most were making profit off it. Things like this is in the past thank god and psychology is a much more trusting profession nowadays. People use to offer their children for this because they had hyperactive disorder, and it technically worked... But it caused other psychological disorders and even brain damage I believe. (Sorry if some info is incorrect, this was extra info for an essay we could of learnt a year ago and I didn't but still remember some of it from lectures)

Actually the same reason that nowadays they take kids to crystal healing, homeopathy, russian stem cell therapy or any such ineffective treatments. If your child is sick you will try anything that might cure him no matter how insane it sounds. Even if it has a one in a million chance what if your kid will be the one in a million. At that time mental disorders were considered much more serious than today and virtually no drugs were available for them. The parents took the only hope they were offered. And usually they were not told about the "side effects".

The worst part about that is her "acting up" that led to the lobotomy, was normal teenage and early 20's hormones. She grew up around brothers that were very successful and she was more than likely just a normal girl that couldn't keep up with the rest of her family's successes.

I've already said this if you look above. Also if you read the article it states:

"He later recanted his skepticism somewhat, after further research showed an Earth-borne signal to be very unlikely, given the requirements of a space-borne reflector being bound to certain unrealistic requirements to sufficiently explain the signal.[10] Also, the 1420 MHz signal is problematic in itself in that it is "protected spectrum": bandwidth reserved for astronomical purposes in which terrestrial transmitters are forbidden to transmit."

Apparently, damage to certain parts of your brain will give you eating compulsions, so it's theorized that he may have had brain damage.

To everyone treating this like an unassociated event, Megan Fox was not cast in Transformers 3 after EP Stephen Spielberg took issue with her comparing Michael Bay to Hitler.  

OP is implying that if there's no Hitler, there's no Holocaust, and Spielberg doesn't get upset about a comment that doesn't get made... thus, Douche Witwicky doesn't wind up leaving his supermodel girlfriend of which the relationship is plausible due to their shared world-saving experience and winding up with his 2nd supermodel girlfriend that makes no sense at all (and who subsequently is involved in key parts of the movie where she effectively single handedly saves the moment, thus being directly responsible for saving EARTH and the entire human race)

TL;DR - Transformers 3 makes no fucking sense.  Hitler should have just targeted the Bay and LaBeouf families.

what was the hitler comment? 

edit: nevermind here it is 
"He's like Napoleon and he wants to create this insane, infamous mad-man reputation," Fox told the magazine. "He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is. So he's a nightmare to work for but when you get him away from set, and he's not in director mode, I kind of really enjoy his personality because he's so awkward, so hopelessly awkward. He has no social skills at all. And it's endearing to watch him."

He wasn't actually that terrible a military leader, he was just overzealous. His generals continuously told him not to attack, to wait, and yet he went on ahead with it. Over the course of a month, they conquered Poland. Over the course of another month about a year down the line, they conquered France. If *this* isn't confirmation that your thoughts about your overcautious generals are correct, then I don't know what is.

In fact, had Operation Barbarossa been initiated *when it was supposed to be,* (and focused more on Moscow and less on other targets), the Germans may well have defeated the Soviets. Barbarossa was delayed because the Italians fucked up the Greek campaign (like every campaign they were involved in), and the Germans had to go fix it.

As the crowd headed to the lobby I grabbed her arm and took her out a completely different exit, away from the main parking lot.  Outside she looked at me with a WTF look.  I told her if there is an emergency scenario to blindly obey me, as I've already considered the options.

I was actually at the Station a few months before this fire. It was a Kiss tribute band and the lead singer had a candelabra and did a little fire breathing a la Gene Simmons. Anyway, I remember thinking very clearly what I would do if the place caught fire and what my backup plans would have been. There weren't half as many people that night as during this event, and a fire still would have been pretty devastating.

Normally, I'd supply a link to a claim like this, but I really don't want to accidentally run through a single second of that video again to make sure it's the one I'm talking about. All I know is that it's certainly on Reddit somewhere and probably elsewhere, too.

Edit: Not sure why this is being downvoted, though I'll assume it's because I refused to find the right video and post it for others' convenience. Now, I watch a lot of fucked up stuff. For example, /r/WTF is actually one of my favorite subreddits where no link stays blue. But that video? No. I don't mind if others link it because it helps spread the awareness of the issues that arose in this incident, arguably in an effective manner if one also educates his/herself on the aspects of the trial and its ensuing consequences (good and bad) for safety policies. 

Instead, here's a link of the foundation for the fire victims you can donate to: http://www.stationfirememorialfoundation.org/

taken directly from his source link...

ZAHN: Bush knew he had to stay out of enemy hands. But he had no idea just what capture on Chichijima would have meant. The island was the site of some of the most horrific atrocities in the Pacific. 

KENNEL: That's the tree right there.

ZAHN: Two months before Bush's mission, Bill Kinnel was shot down over Chichijima on his first ever-combat mission and captured by the Japanese. 

KINNEL: I was tied to this tree and I spent the night here. And a local man came up and said that I had killed his son. And he placed a rifle barrel right between my eyes and he was going to shoot me. But fortunately, the guards chased him away. ZAHN: Kinnel was tied to two different trees for as long as 14 hours at a time.

KINNEL: I realized how lucky I was to have survived the eight days that I was here. 

It seemed like almost yesterday that -- that it all happened. 

ZAHN: He would be the last American to leave the island alive. Those who came after would face even more brutal treatment and a horrific death. Their stories are chronicled by James Bradley in his book, "Flyboys."

BRADLEY: You always hear the phrase, "against the Geneva Convention." That the Japanese did disobeyed the Geneva Convention. Ridiculous, they didn't consider the Geneva Convention. When the emperor declared war on the United States, he specifically left out any mention of honoring international agreements.

ZAHN: Without international protections, Japanese officers on Chichijima, like Major Suo (ph) Matoba were able to commit crimes so horrible, they hadn't even been specifically outlawed in the rules of war.

BRADLEY: And in this guy's twisted, brutal mind, the Japanese spirit could be fed, could be heightened by the killing of American POWs. And then subsequently, actually consuming their livers in terms of getting the spirit out of the enemy.

ZAHN: By the war's end, eight flyers had been killed on Chichijima, most by beheading. After many executions, a Japanese doctor was brought in.

BRADLEY: The doctors had to cut open the American on the orders of an officer, even though they found it very objectionable and did not want to perform this type of thing.

ZAHN: Matoba was most interested in the Americans' livers.

BRADLEY: He would have these livers prepared and cut up into tiny bits. You really didn't know what the meat was. And he would serve it at parties, and serve it onto other officers who were eating it unknowingly. 

ZAHN: After Japan's surrender, Matoba faced capital charges at a war crimes trial on Guam.

BRADLEY: Immediately at the end of the war, he asked everyone to cover up. He was embarrassed by his behavior. And he apologized in the course of the trial, but the facts were the facts, and he was hung.

This is from a book called 'Flyboys' which chronicles what happened.  It's a great/harrowing read if you like history.  Basically, the Japanese commander of Chichijima was a raging alcoholic and sociopath.  He was convinced that if he ate the livers and other organs of the men he would gain their strength, so they were beheaded and cooked up.  Also George H.W. Bush was shot down and swam to a tiny uninhabited island where he was later spotted and rescued by an American boat.

Unsure. I think there was a lot of stories about the Japanese being barbaric. It was often said that they hung prisoners upside down from trees and used them for bayonet practice. How true it is I don't know.

Could be in part for the meat, but also the belief (originally from China, I believe) that one of two souls the body has resides in the liver.  So by eating the liver the commanding Japanese officer believed that he was fortifying his soul and the souls of his men.

>Two prisoners were beheaded in a public ceremony and per an account in Time Magazine, their livers were immediately cut from their bodies and served as sukiyaki .[4] It was not disputed that eight prisoners of war were executed, and some of the bodies were butchered by the division’s medical orderlies and portions were eaten by the senior staff of the Japanese garrison.

If you read what he linked, one of the Japanese commanders believed that by eating the liver you absorbed that person's strength.  He would have it chopped up and fed unknowingly to other officers.

Read the book ["Flyboys" by James Bradley](http://books.google.com/books/about/Flyboys.html?id=VjE3PwAACAAJ), you'll get your answers. But to some it up, it was considered tradition to eat the liver of a slain enemy in some fringe sects of Japanese Military culture.

The fireball from the crashed aircraft's exploding fuel tank skewered the bodies, turning the tragic scene into an appetizing, festive barbecue. The Japanese soldiers that arrived at the scene later reported that they have new respect for American food.

It might possibly be true, though it's impossible to verify to any degree of certainty. It's generally thought to be a legend, and the british soldier never knew or claimed it was Hitlers life he had possibly spared, if you want to believe the story.

Most likely not true Hitler was indeed in the army but when he was a young kid  in his teens and not a fighter. There were many rows of trenches leading all the way up to the front line. His job was a runner sending messages between commanders in the back lines not up in the front.

Which reminds me of the WWII story about a completely shot-to-shit American Bomber that was on it's last limb.  Aparently, a lone Luftwaffe fighter plane came across the plane, escorted it out of German airspace, and then left.

It's actually a great story about human compassion and how, even in the middle of war, we still see people as people sometimes.

Which reminds ME of a story from the American Revolution where British marksman ( and inventor of a breechloading rifle) Patrick Ferguson had George Washington in his sights at the Battle of the Brandywine, but was so impressed by the big guy's bravery and majesty that he couldn't bring himself to shoot. This is also probably bullshit.

>As one can imagine, swamps are not pleasant places. They are filled not only with deadly insects and snakes but are truly a nightmare to get through.

I've lived in swamps my whole life, that's a pretty gross exaggeration.  It's mostly just unpleasantly trudging through knee deep water, but it's not a *nightmare.*

Snakes pretty much leave you alone unless you step on them, corner them, or get in their nest. 

Insect borne diseases are a big deal, but you don't need to be in a swamp for that, anywhere with standing water will do.

As for crocs I'm not totally sure, but if they're anything like gators they're just territorial and fairly skittish outside their territory.   Gators do a lot of warning hissing and aggressive warning moves before attacking.

The hardest part about swamp hikes/rucks is the slow pace, thick brush, and navigating around the standing water.  Progress is always slow, and a mile an hour isn't an unreasonable pace.

I'm guessing this had more to do with the malaria being rampant and being cornered by a superior fighting force than anything else.

This kind of thing, however, always bugs me. Please don't make it sound like there is a sole Wikipedia writer responsible for this page. The whole idea of Wikipedia is that people knowledgeable on the subject can improve any page so that less people become misinformed. If someone has editorialized to misrepresent the facts, it is up to those who know to fix it (citing their sources, of course) so that everyone benefits as a result.

Beautiful. This story sounded like so much bullshit. 
If you sent 1000 soldiers into the jungle with 1000 starving lions, i bet a thousand bucks maybe 100 people would end up getting eaten. At most, maybe 300.
After they got their fill, they would just lie on their backs with huge erections and sleep (there is no science fact in this statement. I just want to imagine it like that.)

Not to disagree with you, because I am fairly sure most died of disease not crocodiles, but crocs have been known to kill and store food underwater. It's possible the crocs present killed more people than they intended to eat and simply stored them away for later.

Any exposed flesh, I'd imagine.  I've always wanted to ask whether the lady's eyes & mouth were open or closed (in which case the animals would go for something easier to eat instead of specifically aiming to get the tongue & eyes out), and whether the area around the eyes & mouth showed signs of bite marks or if the organs were removed cleanly.  I've never read anything on the Dyatlov Pass incident that mentioned either of those.

Maybe, but that doesn't explain how their tents were torn open from within, and they still had tracks away from them. If the culprit *were* an avalanche, the campsite would have been more throughly disturbed (tents and supplies more broken/half buried) and no tracks seen (unless they left after the avalanche had occurred).

Landscape is too flat for avalanches. Besides, their tent was on top of the hill.
Also, there are lot of other creepy details. All members of the group leaved the tent without outerwear and footwear(was piled next to the tent), and went down the hill, after that they split up, and some was building a fire, while others was hiding in a hollow.

Not just hypothermia - it's something called "altitude sickness", which explains why all their clothes were off and such (for some reason, lots of people take their clothes off despite sub zero temperatures). 

And because I just know someone if going to try and bring up the radiation...there wasn't any. Their skin was orange because it was incredibly sunburned.

It also explains why some of them were half naked.  Whatever clothing wasn't stripped away by the avalanche was shredded off by scavengers.

Still a creepy story though, especially when you look at the pictures taken of them a few days earlier, all laughing and having fun together.

The Russian investigators that found the site were familiar with avalanche indications and found none. 
Also their footprints fleeing the tent were well preserved enough to see that some were barefooted prints and other were made by feet in only socks. 
It was something like -10 that night and experienced skiers like that party would have know to leave the tent for longer than an hour would mean certain death. They fled their tent only because they were more certain they would die if they stayed but no one knows the reason...

It is not. That cracked article was half incorrect half hand-waving, and I hate it with a fury of thousand suns because now every time this topic pops up people repeat it with a knowing look.

Believe cracked all you want, but study the details yourself. The materials are mostly in Russian but there's always google translate. You'll find that it's not even nearly as simple of a story as cracked paints it to be; I'm not rejecting the possibility of an avalanche altogether, but... Read it.

According to the wiki page they were found under several feet of snow 13 feet down in a ravine. They also said there had been no precipitation between the deaths and finding the bodies. So it seems unlikely that scavengers would have been able to get to them

I think you're probably right, but what about the tent being torn from the inside and the group forgoing their clothes? Could be they were frantic to get away from an avalanche, I suppose.

If it was an avalanche how come footprints leading from the tent were clearly visible when people arrived on the scene weeks later? I've always thought the cracked article avalanche story just falls apart with that.

I'm pretty sure I learned about the Donner Party in 4th grade--I've assumed it was part of the state curriculum but that is pretty grim now that I think about it...

I've since read that they're not sure there was any cannibalism and this was many media hype.

> When they came back for those they left behind, all but 1 of them were gone, and evidence suggests the last guy ate the others, despite not needing to for survival's sake.

Lewis Keseberg was the final survivor to be rescued. George Donner, Tamsen Donner, and Levinah Murphy had been the other three who couldn't be evacuated by the previous rescue party, but as far as I know all three bodies were present ~~and there was no evidence that Keseberg ate any part of them~~ (edit: all three had been partly cannibalized, although there is no evidence that Keseberg had murdered any of them). He *did* admit to eating William Eddy's son, as well as to taking some of the Donners' belongings and money. He was accused of murdering Tamsen Donner but was later absolved by historians and by Tamsen's daughter Eliza.

Earlier in the trip, Keseberg had been rather coldblooded, suggesting they hang one man for his crimes, and later forcing an old man to walk instead of ride in his wagon. Keseberg may be the most villainous member of the Donner party, but he's not quite as creepy as you make him out to be.

Only two of them were partially undressed and that is no mystery: others took their clothes after death, probably. (At least this simple explanation itself has no flaws in it; if it's allowed by your preferred global explanation is another question).

But if you study the case properly, you'll see they weren't delirious: their actions as a group were mostly smart. They produced some wood and made a fire; after that didn't help (for some reason people continued to die), the remaining four people made a snow burrow which should have saved them from the wind. They had all chances to live there but died: from the numb crushing blows, not hypothermia.

> Interestingly, because the men went out to hunt and cut wood, not a single child died, and only a few women died.

I'm not sure where you're getting your facts, but you're pretty off the mark. Hunting was largely unsuccessful as game was extremely scarce, and it was difficult to find enough wood to keep the fires lit. Your claim that not a single child died is completely false, as a number of children died, including Louis and Ada Keseberg, Margaret and James Eddy, and Isaac, Lewis, and Samuel Donner.

I get what you're trying to say, that the men did the work and therefore enabled the women and children to survive, and that's partly true. Of the original party, two thirds of the women and children survived, while only one third of the men made it. However, it may have as much to do with physiology as with who did what tasks.

> The survivors were on average 7.5 years younger than those who died; children aged between 6 and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and children under the age of 6, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Keseburgs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths among males aged between 20 and 39 were "extremely high" at more than 66 percent. Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork.

One problem is that when a Senate committee was convened to investigate in the 1970's, it was revealed that countless files about the agency's covert medical experimentation were destroyed admittedly to protect agency employees:  

There is virtually no drug-related MK-ULTRA material in the files, we gather? In terms of destruction of those files, the seven boxes of progress reports that I think you had recalled from the Archives and destroyed on 31 January, was a booklet called "LSD 25, Some Unpsychedelic Implications." Why did you decide to do that?
 
"It was a conscious decision that there were a whole series of things that involved Americans who had helped us with the various aspects of this testing, with whom we had had a fiduciary relationship and whose participation we had agreed to keep secret. Since this was a time when both I and the fellow who had been in charge of the program were going to retire there was no reason to have the stuff around anymore. We kept faith with the people who had helped us and I see nothing wrong with that."

That is one of the more plausible explanations, though according to Wikipedia: 

>This theory's main flaw is that the boarding party found the main hatch secured. Upon going into the hold they did not report smelling any fumes or vapour, which would have still smelled very powerful by that point if this theory were correct. Nor did people who came aboard at Gibraltar and Genoa report smelling any vapours. There was no evidence of alcohol outside the barrels in the hold. What happened to this missing alcohol from the nine empty barrels is as much a mystery as what happened to the crew, although it could have gone missing at any stage of the journey, from before being put on the ship in New York to after Gibraltar.

That is a ridiculous explanation. A barrel of alcohol doesn't just explode, nor do nine of them. We're not in a Hollywood movie. And somehow an explosion would have made the crew immediately decide the ship was haunted and leave it on the spot? Come on.

Also, here is an excerpt from the wikipedia article:

"Deveau returned to his ship and reported to the captain. Two men, Charles Augustus Anderson and Charles Lund, then boarded the Mary Celeste. The cargo of 1,701 barrels of alcohol was, Deveau reported, in good order. However, when it was eventually unloaded in Genoa, nine barrels were found to be empty."

The barrels were not destroyed, just empty.

From what I understand the ability to "crack" TOR would require knowledge of all nodes in the network. With ever increasing capabilities of doing "full-takes" (every packet) this is basically a thing.

For the UK an example:
"TEMPORA is the signals intelligence community's first "full-take" Internet buffer that doesn't care about content type and pays only marginal attention to the Human Rights Act. It snarfs everything, in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation without missing a single bit. Right now the buffer can hold three days of traffic, but that's being improved. Three days may not sound like much, but remember that that's not metadata. "Full-take" means it doesn't miss anything, and ingests the entirety of each circuit's capacity."

I am not knowledgeable enough for the details, but I don't think its unimagineable to have secret services co-operate enough at significant locations such at DE-CIX to Pokemon(gotta catch em all) TOR.

Here is a blog entry to translate in german that has some thoughts on TOR :
http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=af0134f5

I guess in order for TOR to increase unsurveillability it would have to grow faster than the capability of secret services to log "the internet".

The real kicker really is that we have increasing worldwide government legislation that basically says every ISP has to log data for months; that ISPs have to give agencies increasing access on-demand. And in general, it is in the hands of co-operating governments of whether they choose to just add intrusive devices onto hardware as per the recent "btw, we bugged all of our own technology" reveal on an even larger scale.

Ironically enough, a lot of this is happening in free democracies and argued for the sake of freedom.

Considering much of Soviet technological advancement during that time period was obtained via spies in the US, and to a lesser degree  vice versa, I think they would have been pretty evenly advanced just as in the OTL. 

Edit: I'm also not sure what is meant by not being great technologically... medicine/biology, industrial automation and manufacturing methods, atomic and modern physics!!!!!!!!!, aeronautical design (we just didn't have jets yet, but the P-51 was still a better aircraft than anything the Germans had), civil engineering/infrastructure, electrical engineering and power generation (as for electronics, I don't know enough about the early history, but it wasn't like Turing did all the work, there were very significant developments in the US, even IBM was doing some interesting work in the first half of the century), in all of these the US was number 1.

Good question, it's creepy because it means that a good chunk of the advancements the allies have been so proud of could have come from the minds of Nazis, the same minds who contributed to the worst atrocities in history. Essentially it's creepy because we all condemn what the Nazis did but benefit from their experiments in ways most of us probably don't even know and our cultural, medical, psychological, scientific and technological make up is forever tainted with Nazism. 

It's also creepy because the US wiped their identities and allowed former Nazis to live in their country and raise families without anybody ever knowing, effectively stabbing their own people and their allies in the back in their selfish desires to capitalize on Nazi intellectuals.

The Lumbee people have an oral tradition saying that the Roanoke survivors were taken into their community. I don't think there's any reason to doubt it, considering that's what I would have done if I was a starving colonist and there were friendly natives nearby.

I daresay the only reason schoolchildren were ever taught that the colony had mysteriously vanished is because America had taboos about interracial marriage.

It is not 100%, but there have been documented accounts of finding blonde haired, blue eyed Native-Americans shortly after the Roanoke disappearance. The tribe called themselves Croatoans.

Early European colonies in America were very harsh and nasty places to live. Disease, starvation and severe punishment for not working hard enough were common. Plus there wasn't many women.

Walls and guards were put up to keep the colonist in rather than keep the natives out. Runaways were all too frequent.

The most reasonable explanation for Roanoke is that the workers killed their guards and melted into the surrounding native tribes.

Native NC'er here.

It's held that they ran out of supplies, the indians offered to move them ( the colony they set up is within eyesight of the beach, so you can guess how great that land is for farming ) and the colonists moved. Depending on who you ask, either Sir Walter Raleigh gave no fucks about the colonists, or they were convinced the Indian tribes had killed the colonists despite no bones or evidence of that fact being found at the site.

This and the whole " Blackbeard" thing are two out of three things that I sometimes hate about being a Tar Heel.

Yeah, they left a "mysterious" note and then a couple decades later there are accounts of the discovery that the local tribe had a few "mysteriously" fair-skinned members.  Doesn't seem all that mysterious to me, lots of the early European settlers assimilated with the local indiginous people; doesn't seem all that bad to me, especially when the other option is starve/freeze to death.

In the 16th century, it was to be the first permanent English settlement on the American continent. Its proprietor, after a couple of years, was called back to England as the Queen summoned all available ships for war against Spain. When he returned, the colony was abandoned. No trace of them to this day has never been found. Only one clue has been left to guess their fate: The word "CROATOAN", which I believe was the name of a nearby island, was carved into a tree. Many theories have arisen over history as to what happened to them. I think that they most likely assimilated with the natives.

EDIT: Trying to recall stuff I learned some four years ago is tough.

English people make a colony in America. Colonists discover that they are terrible at developing an entire city in a new part of the world and that Native Americans have totally great cheekbones. Colonists decide to live with the attractive neighbors in lieu of freezing toil and leave a note informing any future visitors of such. Englishman arrive to find colonists missing, a note explaining the situation, and are baffled.

Please just watch the video. It's only 10 minutes long and is a TL;DR in itself.

**From the video**"It seemed only right that if a society free of all mental and physical ailments, free of violence and crime, illiteracy and foolishness... it seemed only right to end the reproductive capabilities of people expressing these traits.

Eugenics was the result of an America unwilling to make social changes. An upper-class fearful of its laboring counterparts. Eugenics placed the blame of a social quandary on individual races and classes, and thus freed from culpability the industrial, scientific, and political bearance of the time."

**Wikipedia**
-Eugenics was practiced in the United States many years before eugenics programs in Nazi Germany, and U.S. programs provided much of the inspiration for the latter.

**From the video**
-Hitler wrote positively of the US's immigration restrictions in Mein Kampf.

-"America's Eugenic policies should be used as a model for Germany to follow." *Gerhard Wagner, Head of the National Socialist Physician League, shortly before mobilizing the most comprehensive eugenics legislation in modern history.*

Read what he wrote in his manifesto.  The man *was* a genius, just a very poor writer with a very strange mind.  Well, and he was murderer....but we know that already.  Being a murderer doesn't make what you say incorrect, it just makes you a very major asshole.  

He did do something few social/political commentators do; he discussed why he felt the very structure of our political system is inherently flawed.  Plenty of people do that and see different flaws and solutions, but Ted brought something up I have never read from any other source.  Even if you disagree with his diagnosis of American society, and you likely will, you can still appreciate an original thought that has the potential to make you see things in a different way.

He still hates socialists and liberals...oh my how he hates liberals as he defines them.

The thing I agreed with most was his view of technology, yet here I am.  We can kind of see some of what he said play out in a few nations right now.

I find it really surprising that it hasn't been turned into a major movie yet. Very fascinating story, but I think it'd be difficult to tell the story without either provoking sympathy with the main character or turning him into another one-dimensional Hollywood cliche villain. 

The end-game is also not your standard Hollywood action movie finale: the guy evaded capture for years while the FBI and other agencies spent a shitload of money and manpower trying to uncover his identity, but it wasn't a rogue hero agent or savvy journalist who uncovered the secret. His own brother turned him in after he recognized the writing style, partly because he hoped to avoid the death sentence.

I still think it makes for an amazing script, but it's too dangerous to get produced by any major studio. Maybe after he dies..

I would actually recommend watching simply because, while it is a scary and fucked up drug, it's actually interesting and the documentary is super good.  
    
However, basically there is a tree in South America called the Borrucheru tree. You can literally use any part of the tree to get high; the root, the flower, the fruit, etc. This tree grows everywhere in Colombia. It grow in their national parks, in the middle of cities and it's actually a really common tree. The most potent part is the seeds and they are often extracted for the processing of Scopolamine.  
    
There are some similarities between this drug and cocaine. For starters, you need to chemically alter the originally plant to make the drug. Secondly, they have the same look, weight and density. How is it different? Other than just about everything chemically, **a gram of Scopolamine has the toxicity to kill a dozen grown men.**  
    
In the documentary, they meet with a drug dealer who knows a lot of the drug and where to get it; it's actually quite hard to obtain because of how delicate and dangerous it is. Airborne particles of the drug are enough to put you under it's influence. What happens when you are under the influence? Experts have compared it to "chemical hypnosis". You are completely open to suggestion and will want to help people rob you or help them with whatever it is that they want. The whole time you are on the drug, you appear to be coherent and sober, thus making it hard to know that someone is under it's influence and protect them from it.  
    
It was even used by ancient societies when a king died and would be given to his mistresses so that they would voluntarily join him in his tomb.  
    
The natural form isn't too friendly either. The drug dealer talked about doing Datura (the natural form) by eating 1 1/2 of the fruits with a friend and he tripped **for 17 days**. His friend did more and, partially, is permanently stuck in the trip.  
    
TL;DR - Scopolamine is a drug that has only criminal use. It is used to rob, rape or kill. It is so potent, that airborne particles can put you under its influence. While under the influence you will listen to anyone's suggestions, you may even go out of your way to help them. To outsiders, it is almost impossible to tell that someone is on Scopolamine.

except everyone is right. Military targets were picked to justify the selection, sure, but there were "justifiable" targets in every city. The cities were picked because they were untouched by allied fire bombing, therefore damage assessment would be easy. So many cities were ravaged by fire bombing that there was a very short list of possible targets to begin with.

These were very complicated choices with many factors, to say the cities were selected because of some Army HQ is just as wrong (and correct) as several other factors. The most correct thing said is that Nagasaki was selected because it was the backup target and weather precluded the primary target.

Actually, it's slightly true. They WERE first picked because of their "unbombed nature". Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two of four major cities I believe that had remained untouched throughout the war and the US wanted to see how much damage these bombs could do, while also hitting major innocent cities. They steered clear of Tokyo because killing the emporer and high officials wouldn't send as big of a message.

There was multiple [targets](http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html#D) selected for bombing and you are correct that Nagasaki wasn't one of them.

Kyoto was also spared from most bombing before the Atomic bombs where dropped.  Part of the reason why it now has the reputation of having so many old and beautiful shrines, temples, and palaces.  

On a side note if you or anyone ever get the chance to visit either the Atomic bomb museums in Nagasaki or Hiroshima I urge you to go.  They both are very different in how they display what happened to each city, and are two places that I will never forget visiting.

Yes, there was also a Mitsubishi manufacturing plant there too, but that's not why it was targeted.  It was struck because we had clear skies, and could see the "target"  (which was a supposed military bunker, but the bomb dropped 200 yards off and hit a hospital instead, {it's not like it matters WHAT your target was in a nuclear war}.

So, that is why Shintoism is still a majority religion in Japan today?  That doesn't sound like a successful mission to me, (especially since Hirohito was allowed to live the rest of his life as the honorary emperor as Japan until he died in 1989).  "Unconditional surrender" my hairy white ass.  We gave the Japs everything they wanted as a condition of surrender.

It amazes me how desperately people try to justify this thing, saying that there was "no other way" to push an island country with pretty much no allies into surrender. 

Or how people kid themselves: The US had a big new toy that symbolized a significant amount of power in their hands...but only if the world knew about it. No one was going to believe that we could make a city-destroying bomb just because we said we could, and even if they did...no one was going to believe that we had the stones to actually use such a device. Unless, of course, we actually DID put it to use.

There were some military advantages gained here, absolutely. Japan surrendered in record time, and the bombs definitely facilitated that. 

But to sit here and pretend that we had "no other option" than to murder tens of thousands of civilians? Or that it was the "best" and most "humane" option at our disposal? Yeah, fuck all that.

These bombs were dropped to show off to the world that the US had the biggest dick.

I'll agree with you on your final sentence, but I'll disagree with you on your first paragraph.  

It's the display of overwhelming force that made them want to surrender.  I'll use a conventional example.  You walk up on a fight, it's 50 men on 10 men.  Obviously the 50 men are winning.  Duh, that's not a stunner.  You keep on walking, and you see one single man kicking the shit out of 10 men singlehandedly.  Wouldn't you want to get away from that crazy son of a bitch too?

Or to relate it to the time; 

*"Before, it took America 200 planes to firebomb one city.  Now it's one plane, one city!  These crazy Americans have hundreds of thousands of planes, so what if they have hundreds of thousands of these bombs?  Fuck this!  I quit!  I surrender!  Yes, We propose the exact same scenario for surrender as before!  We quit!  Rebuild us!"*

Also, The USSR did not declare war on Imperial Japan until they had surrendered to the USA.  The USSR was late to the game.

Both pale in comparison to the casualties taken on behalf of the USSR.  Not only did they have the enemy shooting at them from the front, they had their own "comrades" shooting at them from the rear if they retreated.  Conditions were so bad in the USSR under Stalin's army, that Soviet troops defected to the Nazis.

Do you mean the most plausible explanation is he was shot by this secret service agent?

Also, by no means am I a ballistics expert or historian so I am not asserting the official story is false or that I have a better explanation, but the whole thing about how his head snapped back and how the wound on the back of his head was far larger (more consistent with an exit wound) really is a sticking point for me. 

I'm not saying this is enough to throw out the official story or anything, it's just that if you presented me the facts about the wound and the Zapruder film, I would have definitely assumed the shot came from in front of the motorcade. 

By all means, if someone can explain this phenomenon to me, I would appreciate it. I'm not looking to be argumentative.

I don't think it would have been that different or even better for that matter.

The scale and uglyness of WW2 is what caused big political changes and especially in Europe, a huge and lasting change in mindset.

Europe is so pacifistic these days, because we were smack bang in the middle of the absolute terror WW2 represented. Same reason why Russia and China, even though they have the people aren't that happy to actually fight wars.

The sheer amount of people they lost, utterly dwarfs every other nations losses, especially the US's. The US came into the game extremely late and have since stolen the show in terms of claiming fame in history, but they barely lost anyone during WW2, not even 0.001% of the amount of people Russia or China lost.

And I think that might be the root cause for why the US still has a well above average appetite for war, while their biggest competitors remain reluctant to actually act.

People in this thread are really getting off to the "Hitler, different path, much different history, much no WWII." It's pretty hard to think that an emasculated world power like Germany after WWI would have quietly paid reparations for the next 70 years as it's people starved during an international depression all due to a war that they didn't start years earlier. If Hitler would've been painting in the 1930s some other asshat would've done the dictator job for him.

They have an automated system that registers a large sum of phone calls, texts, internet activity, etc. It picks out anything suspicious and alerts the NSA to look into it. There are varying levels of suspicion and urgency for NSA agents IIRC. The worst part is they store just about every bit of data regardless of importance. 

Mind you this is just what I interpreted from what I've read, I'm not sure if it's all 100% true.

There were indeed some sort of secret military tests carried out, people speculate that it was for advanced anti-radar shielding which is now in use, but its disputed if the USS Eldridge was even in the area at that time. Some of the crew members involved done interviews years later, but were sworn to secrecy about any military operations, and discounted the scare stories described. I find it hard to believe that something as crazy as this could have happened and been covered up for so long. Still, it makes for a creepy story.

There is incredibly strong evidence that her plane crashed just off the beach on the Island of Nikumaroro where several artifacts including torn clothing, a broken hand lotion bottle and pieces of shoes identical to the ones Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan had used/worn during their plane flight were found.  The remnants of her plane, according to "TIGHAR-funded sonar imaging just west of Nikumaroro Island bears a resemblance to the fuselage of Earhart's Lockheed Electra" exactly where her last radio message and final coordinates would've placed her.

And that book pretty well describes how it must feel to have a lobotomy.

I made the mistake of reading it at a time in my life where I was suffering from a depression that had severely hampered my ability for abstract thought and analysis and it almost paralysed me with fear. 

I'm still worried that I'll never regain some of what that fucking depression cost me in mental capacity. I still have a hard time concentrating sometimes. Flowers for Algernon is basically my own personal vision of hell.

Yeah, people think surgery is super advanced these days. It's not. It's still the same, messy thing that absolutely wrecks the body. Anything can go wrong. You know when you open up a computer and a wire isn't where the instruction manual said it would be? The human body can be like that, but even worse. And, instead of messing up something temporarily, cutting the wrong "wire" in the body can get bad fast. So no matter how "minor" the surgery, every time you go under the knife you are given a heads up that it could mean your death.

They wanted her to stop freaking out. She showed early signs of retardation, possibly epileptic, and had violent mood swings. They were hoping the lobotomy would calm her, but they went "too far" and made her much, much worse.

I'm sure they slept perfectly fine.  If the Dr. Freeman in the article is Dr. Walter Freeman, the man popularized the transorbital lobotomy as a cure for all manner of mental illness.  This was before the era of reliable psychiatric drugs, when lobotomy was seen as practically a godsend for patients and caretakers alike.  He saw no problem with using a lobotomy to calm a violent schizophrenic or to give relief to an anxiety-ridden housewife, or to make an unruly pre-teen boy fall in line.  I've read a book about his life and another written by the recipient of his final lobotomy procedure.  It was a fascinating and terrifying period of medical science.

Yes I believe he burnt the penis and both of them found it too tough to chew.  I watched the documentary several years back, its an amazing story really.  The man ended up in prison and he helps German investigators hunt other cannibals.  I don't remember the exact number, but he claimed there was several hundred ACTIVE cannibals in Germany alone.  Amazing what goes on behind closed doors.

Wolf of Wall Street was amazing, and the script for Devil in the White City is solid, they just need to attach the right filmmaker a renew Leo's interest in actually making the movie. It's been gestating for a long time, which often means it's never actually going to happen. A period piece with a serial killer as it's main character isn't an easy sell with out Leo (or someone of his ilk) attached to star.

He didn't say Holmes was the first serial killer (Jack the Ripper was another  infamous serial killer at the time); he's saying the term was coined because of him.

No, serial killers commit murders in series, as opposed to en masse, or amidst a spree.  There are a number of strikingly prolific serial killers with only days or weeks between killings because their circumstances and chosen victims combine to form a wealth of opportunity and dearth of suspicion.  There is overlap between the names we assign to various types of murderers, but the time separation need not be considerable, as the time gaps are a function of the environment, not the killer.

I can't find anything to corroborate the allegation that it is "totally sexed up".  If anything, after having read a few pages on and collections of reviews of it, I'm more inclined to read it, as historiographic criticisms are few.  The only people I've been able to find railing against it in a general way are Stormfront types (for obvious reasons).  
  
It's possible this is a broadly inaccurate text and its inaccuracy has simply gone under the radar and fooled most contemporary readers in the process.  But it would seem surprising.  
  
That having said, anything you can point to to that effect would certainly be of interest.

Eh, he was worse than most Nazis. The experiments he did on Jews, twins, and Gypsies were torture.  He might have helped one family (maybe) but he was a sadistic monster.  You can cloak it under the guise of "science" but it was nothing more than subjecting people to ridiculous torture because he could.

The death-camp Sonderkommando, who were always inmates, should not be confused with the SS-Sonderkommandos which were ad hoc units formed from various SS officers between 1938 through 1945.

/u/kgram's response is spot on, but I want to add to it that Sonderkommando were picked from the trains while still healthy, always the strongest of the men.  Every three months or so, the unit was murdered and new Sonderkommando were picked.  Some of them actually rebelled, in the book they have a little firefight with the Nazi guards and manage to blow up a few of the furnaces before being gunned down.

Just because the world isn't black and white doesn't mean it's all the same shade of gray, and to respond to a discussion of the Holocaust with "but the Allies committed atrocities too" is at best irrelevant.

False equivalence. While some soldiers committed atrocious acts on the Allies side, the overall MO was not geared that way. To compare the Allied troops and, say, Japanese troops and say there's anything approaching equivalence is ignorant.

It is my understanding that the only medical experiments of the Nazis that provided any value at all was information on the effects of freezing temperatures on humans.  These experiments were performed at Dachau by Dr Rascher.

Vivisection is a live dissection, coming from vivi meaning life, and section, meaning cutting open.

Vivi - from **Vivere** (latin) *To Live*. Also **Vivir** - Spanish for *To Live*. Prefix for many words; Vivacious, Vivid, Vivarium, Vivisection etc. 

-section - suffix from latin **dissecare**; *to cut to pieces*

So basically, *To cut to pieces while still alive*

You need to look at it from an ethical standpoint: immoral actions should be punished. What kind of precedent does that set if you run horrific, inhumane, deplorable experiments, but the data you get is very valuable so then you are off the hook?

Some good *didn't* come from it. The data obtained was primarily sought after so it could be utilized in the US's biological weapons program. We wanted to know how to cause just as much horrid destruction as the Japanese did by hand with ordinance instead, we just found a way to research it without actually using chemicals or pathogens on actual people. The Japanese did it for us.

How much of that work was rigorous, well controlled, experiments that could be considered reliable data?

No really, give me a clear answer here before you make snappy one liners. 

As someone who is working on his PhD in science, from what I can tell, a large amount of the shit that was passed off as "science" in those camps wasn't up to par when it came to experimental design. Because of its poor design its utility is limited at best.

Retrospectively, given that anti-intellectuals love to tie any science done today back to the holocaust or similar death camps run by the Japanese because there was "science" done there too, it would have been better if we hanged all the fuckers instead and used the data as public evidence as to why we hanged the evil SOBs.

Right but I was thinking since the bomb detonated 30 minutes after the 911 call the plan must have been for Wells to be en route somewhere else when the bomb detonated? Seems too unpredictable and not long enough a time to determine where he'd be and pick up the money before anyone noticed a dead guy I'd think, especially if he were driving or walking in a populated area. Wouldn't it have been better to not time the bomb and simply detonate it manually when he met back up with them? Or set it for like an hour and a half and then send him to a remote are and tell him they'd meet him there and then not show until after detonation time. I don't know, just doesn't seem like they chose the easiest solution

(Be advised that the Ellsworth book is one of the saddest goddamn things you'll ever read, as a big chunk of it is short biographies (many with photos) of the kids who were injured or killed.

Example:
> Donald J. Huffman, born July 10, 1917, at Longley, Ohio, was in the fourth grade.
> 
> Both legs were broken and one leg had a compound fracture. His arm was broken at the wrist. About half of his right cheek bone was cracked and had to be taken off. His whole cheek from above his ear was torn loose and just hanging on one side so his teeth and eyeball could be seen. His eye was lacerated badly, but now it is healed so you can only see a portion of his eye in the corner next to his nose, then there is a cataract growing over that. He is blind in that eye. Donald was cut in many other places, mostly on the back. He was unconscious for ten days and there were no hopes for him for over two weeks. The doctors say that he was the most cut and bruised of any child in the school, dead or alive.
> 
> Donald gets nearly hysterical when it storms. He says he does not want to go back to school again for fear someone will dynamite him. He is in the hospital at this date, August 10, 1927, but expects to be home soon. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel B. Huffman.

So, anyway, caveat emptor.)

I was just saying there was a link. Distance doesn't stop people from killing in other areas. People still are going missing. Madison Scott a girl from Vanderhoof went missing a couple years ago. Flyers and billboards are up all over the place. Unfortunately many of the missing women's families don't have the finances to make billboards and such to bring it to every bodies attention. A guy from Fort Saint James BC was purportedly to have killed a few women and he was caught in Alberta http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-man-accused-of-being-serial-killer-1.1080350 . I know of a few people that went to school with him. Some creepy shit happens in Fort St. James sometimes like http://www.pgfreepress.com/four-arrested-in-connection-with-fribjon-bjornson-murder/ I knew his room-mate and the people accused. I heard rumours of what happened in surprising detail. Many people there knew what was going on. These communities are small. There is lots of alcohol, drug abuse and gang affiliations in this area. People don't trust the police and it hinders the justice system greatly. Yet some of the police here don't make it easy with all the accusations of rape and overall crookedness.

You're talking about the Toba catastrophe as if it veritably happened, when it is more likely that it didn't. [There is plenty of evidence that runs contrary to the theory.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/30/supervolcano-eruption-toba-human-extinction_n_3184293.html)

Seeing as that there is evidence the local populations of humans in the areas near Toba survived the eruption, I seriously doubt that the eruption would have killed off the vast majority of humans on the planet.

It seems as if you're trying to claim that modern levels of intelligence came about in our species because of this super eruption. That would be a specious argument (pardon me whilst I congratulate myself on my clever word use).

I remind you that the aboriginal people of Australia had left Africa as a distinct breeding population and were 10,000 to 20,000 years on their way to Indonesia by that time. How many of them were in their own bottleneck? How big was their own individual bottleneck and how many breeding pairs should we reduce the modern Caucasian, Asian and African bottle neck by to account for them?

Actually, come to think of it, were the ancestors of the modern Asians already migrated out of Africa? What was their individual bottleneck? How about the Caucasians?

Not to mention that *four separate species of human survived this event.* Not the least of which was homo floresiensis, endemic to the Indonesian isle from whence their name comes.

I don't know.  What I do know is that in the 35000 years since the last extinction event humanity had taken to living in africa.  After that one 75000 years ago we branched out and took over the world.

Actually I don't think you understand what I meant:  120,000 years ago humanity was almost wiped out as well.  We came back stronger.  75,000 years ago we were reduced to a population of 20,000 or so.  After that we took over the planet.

See the thing about extinction events is typically the survivors do so because they are resistant to the executioner.  Like if you had a race of bugs in various shades of grey, if a forest fire swept through the darker bugs would be more likely to survive because they'd blend in better with the ash.  Or after the black plague ended, the majority of the survivors were resistant or immune to it.  So something in that extinction event wiped out not just us, but also competitors that could have prevented us from spreading out from Africa.

Conversely, insects can't build biological weaponry capable of wiping out entire species unlike human beings. Furthermore they lack the thought process to ever declare war, so if we decided we didn't want there to be insects anymore, we could severely reduce their number. 

Not that we would, it'd be stupid and take an incredible amount of time and resources, but we COULD. Whereas insects literally CANT wipe out humans. Thats not to say they lack the means, just that they lack the basic intellect to even consider that kind of goal.

Dominant means we can kill every single thing on this planet if we want to. We just decide not to because that would be stupid. That's what dominant means.

If there was another species that could kill us at their 100% vs our 100%, meaning a lion at full health versus a man with a nuclear bomb, then we wouldn't be dominant.

The fact that we organise ourselves made us dominant, although other  animals organize themselves. The only reason we are dominant is because we can build very complicated utensils that animals can't.

Ahhh, the old "Icy Strangler" AKA "Rasputin Always Swallows". So here's what you do guys:

Next time you're getting a bj, you need to warm up her throat with some encouraging gentle massage. This will actually cause the throat muscles to relax, allowing you to go deeper. Then, when you feel the time is right, reach under your bed for that hidden bag of ice and quickly wrap it around her neck! Faster than you can say "Wasn't that a delightful gag?!" her mammalian diving reflex will have trapped your member in her throat.

"Even with your head above water, a splash of cold water in your face from a boat’s wake as it cruises
by you can cause you to involuntarily inhale water, which is a killer. Not swallowing in down your throat
into your stomach but inhaling it into your lungs. This is the “gasp reflex.” "

Happens in all water, though usually at a chance of around 10%. The throat closes to prevent drowning, and asphyxiates you. Usually called dry drowning, as opposed to wet (lungs filled with external water) or secondary (lungs filled with water from your body as a reaction to inhaling a small amount, usually happens after the initial incident).

This isn't entirely true. When I was an observer on alaskan fishing boats they would coach us to cover our mouths when we jumped into water if we were ever forced to bail from a boat because the extreme cold would make us reflexively gasp for air. And having jumped into the Bering Sea off the coast I can attest to the reflex.

Not exactly true, though this may happen occasionally for the most part the build up of carbon dioxide in your blood causes that pain you feel when you hold your breath, eventually that pain becomes unbarable and people try to inhale, putting water into their lungs.

I participated in a Mud Run (one of those marine obstacle course things) a couple years ago. It was in the spring and not warm at all. One of the obstacles is to jump into water and swim about 50 feet. The water was really cold and I jumped in and my throat promptly closed up. Most terrifying thing ever. I couldn't breathe, even when I tried to get on my back to "relax" and open my lungs up. But nope. I had to swim over to the side, pull myself up on the wall out of the water so my throat could relax. And then I just took a deep breath and got back in, and that was my only breath for the swim. Never doing that obstacle again.

I'm not sure I understand this.  It sounds like what you're saying is when you submerge your face in cold water, your throat closes, meaning you can't breathe - even if you wanted to?  If that's the case, SCUBA divers/snorkelers wouldn't be able to breathe.

Also I found no reference to throat-closing on the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_diving_reflex) entry for this.  Maybe I'm just not getting something.

When you die don't all of your reflexes and systems just "let go".  I'd imagine that the mammalian diving reflex would cease, thus allowing water to enter the lungs at about the same time that Rsputin pooped the river.

According to an unpublished autopsy report and its later reviews (mentioned in the Wikipedia page)...

>It could not be determined with certainty that he drowned, as the water found in his lungs is a common non-specific autopsy finding.

So it seems there was some water in his lungs, but not enough so as to be associated with death by drowning.

The thing about that game is that you think that once you see a monster or progress in the game, it will get less scary as you become more brave.

Nope. It gets worse and worse and worse. Brilliant game. The level of difficulty it takes to scare someone to that degree is an art form.

Those are medieval fabrications. Look it up. The wikipedia page unfortunately repeats that falsehood. That never happened. Hell, look at the talk page for the wikipedia page on the brazen bull and you will see editors wondering why that fiction is stated as fact on the page.
  
At least the page admits that the Catholic church denounces such information as a fabrication. At least when it pertains to saints being killed. Because none were killed in real life that way.

Fun fact: A "Broken Arrow" is military jargon for a nuclear weapon gone missing (note that the B-47 in question here did not actually carry nuclear bombs); the plot of the movie "Broken Arrow" actually revolves around stolen nuclear weapons, which is referred to as "Empty Quiver", not "Broken Arrow".

Whhhhhat the fuck. I keep wondering why North Korea is getting away with the shit they do. More often than not, people are making jokes about Kim Jung Un and North Korea in general. I will agree that some of the things they do seem incredibly outdated and somewhat laughable [such as the angry fax they recently sent to South Korea](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1th590/north_and_south_korea_exchange_faxes_threatening/). However, there are serious human rights being violated, and I feel that a lot of people are making a joke about it all rather than realizing the severity of everything. Why is this not a bigger deal? 

Edit: I should note that I am currently living in South Korea. I will say that about 98% of the Korean university students that I teach literally laugh when I mention North Korea or Kim Jung Un. He and North Korea are now seen as something to joke about. South Koreans are so close, yet so disconnected from the entire situation. North Koreans are their OWN PEOPLE! These are Koreans being tortured, starved, killed, and who knows what. Yes, I realize that we are all people, so it should not make a difference if they are Korean or not. Humans are suffering, and that is the main point. Regardless, for some reason as an American,  I personally feel more connected to a story when I hear that Americans were involved. I don't know why that's the case, but it's true. I guess what I am getting at is that these people are their relatives, their great grandparents, perhaps. How can South Koreans not care more about their ancestors in the North?

I read a post saying that other pictures of her showed her wearing glasses, but she doesn't have them on in the video. With her being hard of sight without them, she accidentally hits the "hold door" button on the elevator, which stops it from opening. (Watch the video again, just after she hits all of the buttons you can see the door close around 2 inches then stop)   
The weird hand movements were supposedly her being confused by the elevator not working, and waving her hands around to see if there was some sort of motion sensor she needed to set off for it to work. You can see that she walks out behaving normally, stands at the side of the elevator, then at around 1:57 puts her arm straight with the wrist bent, waving her arm up and down in the doorway to try and set it off. It looks unnatural because of the perspective of the camera.

EDIT: It's just around 0:13 in the video. Just as she's stepping back from the buttons you can see the door begin to close, stop, then go back into the wall.

You're looking at the wrong thing. It doesn't matter how long it takes for the doors to slide shut. 

Rather, you'd need to find out how long the doors stay open after the internal 'open door' button or external call button is hit, and how long the doors stay open after the door frame sensor is tripped. Those delays happen before the doors start to shut and you can't tell those things from the video. 

Newer elevators have ways to make sure the car isn't stuck for too long on one floor. But this is an older elevator in a crappy hotel. She could have glitched it and gotten it stuck by pressing all those buttons and running in and out. Equally likely is that the 'open door' button and door frame sensor simply made the door stay open for long enough for her to get herself stuck by repeatedly triggering the delays.

Ready for another long post? 

I think it's a crazy coincidence that the test is called LAM-ELISA. 

However, before the story gained such a following, I'd guess that the test result would come up as one of the first results for Elisa Lam. Even now, if you google Lam Elisa instead of Elisa Lam, most of the results deal with TB. The similarity would be fairly easy to discover. 

Now, TB. Tuberculosis is not that rare. There are a few thousand cases in California every single year (down to ~2,200 in 2012 from ~5,400 in 1992). [Here's a PDF report](http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/tb/Documents/TBCB_Report_2012.pdf) from the California Department of Public Health. 

Based on that table, you can see the LA has a significant percent of the TB cases. There are a few reasons for this. LA is the most populated city in California and TB is more common in overcrowded areas. People who use drugs, have weakened immune systems, live in poverty, and have a poor diet are more likely to develop TB after being exposed to the bacteria. In other words, the hotel itself would be a perfect place for TB to spread, and it's not surprising it happened in the same general area. 

The fact that an outbreak happened a block away within a few weeks makes sense by the numbers. LA had more than 600 cases of TB in 2012. If a TB outbreak happened five blocks away two weeks earlier, people would read into that. Or if it happened a month later and three blocks away. 

The thing is that LA would continue to have TB outbreaks in the hotel area if Lam never visited, and she would always share her name with the test. It's only 'significant' because of where she died. It would also be 'significant' if she died of TB or she became an infectious disease specialist or robbed a hospital with TB kits or whatever. 

To me, the only crazy coincidence is that she shared her exact name with the test, not that she was sort of close to a TB outbreak.

An [ELISA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELISA) is a common bio test.  Home pregnancy tests are ELISAs, and the name is an acronym.  With that in mind I think it's just a coincidence that the dead girl's name was Elisa.  Elissa (with a bonus 's') was the name of the [Queen of Carthage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido_(Queen_of_Carthage)#Virgil.27s_Aeneid) in the *Aeneid*.  I'm sure there are some parallels that could be drawn between the two, but they're about as worthwhile (in my mind) as the connection between a dead girl and an ELISA.

You're right. When I first posted that I thought the bipolar story was a cover-up someone posted this blog as a citation of her having bipolar disorder so I stopped following the story (the blog had her picture on it, maybe it was someone who knew her). Much more creepy if it's not true that she was bipolar.

Tumblr does allow you to set up a queue for posts, to post at later dates in various intervals, or even schedule posts for specific dates in the future.

However, I'd prefer to think that her blog isn't running after her death. It's just a little unsettling.

Edit: Well at least it's not hers. The scheduling of posts so late would be super weird if it was, so case closed on that account.

Edit 2: Seems there's a chance it's her blog after all.

> At first, Elisa enters the elevator and apparently presses all of its buttons. She then waits for something to happen but, for some reason, the elevator door doesn’t shut. She starts to look around, as if she is expecting (or hiding from) someone. At 1:57, her arms and hands start moving in a very strange matter (almost not human) as she appears to be talking to someone, something … or nothing at all. She then walks away. The elevator door then shuts and appears to start working again.

I don't know if you still needed that, considering how many posts there are now explaining/analyzing it but the video's really just unnerving.

You just answered your own question:

Maid says it's haunted: perhaps dude was there already making weird noises, perhaps she was just a nutter

Maid dies on her first day: coincidence? Or the killer was afraid the maid had left to rat him out and decided to move then

Footprints going to the house but not away: in keeping with him coming from the forest and not leaving, which would be explained by him...

killer lived in the house for several days: tada. Which is logical if he was doing it to live.  The house was a place to stay and a place that had food, and I doubt a man driven to murder a family in their beds was very stable mentally.

If I understand correctly, in "successful" lobotomies that had been completed in the past, the person would basically just forget the problems that had been causing them to act out in the first place. Again, from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy#Effects)  (sorry high school teachers): 

*Lobotomy patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition. They may also exhibit difficulty putting themselves in the position of others because of decreased cognition and detachment from society.*

Basically the Kennedys were not the best parents, and instead of finding their daughter real help, they decided to take their chances with a horrible surgery that in the best case scenario, would have made her into a shell of a person who was easier to care for because she wouldn't know or care what the fuck was going on around her.

Why would we send any of that stuff? Some literature and a few major speeches are hardly a representation of humanity. And the point of the message wasn't to transmit technical knowledge. From the way I see it, the thing I would first and foremost be most interested about an alien civilization, if we were bounded by the laws of physics, would be a snippit of their society. How they interact. How similar and different it is to ours. Tweets would be much more capable of this then a few manufactured speeches, literature and a list of prime numbers and mathematical equations.

Hitler has to exist, because he represents the least worst-timeline.  No Hitler?  German fascists still exist, but there's also a powerful Communist movement opposing them.  German Civil War breaks out, USSR intervenes.  The UK wants to intervene, but Communism had huge support among the French people and intellectuals at the time, and the UK refuses to go alone.

The result is an alternate history where all of continental Europe is under the Iron Curtain.   Without the EEC, the trade with the continent, the UK also suffers economically and undergoes a communist revolution.    Since the entire developed world has gone Communist, support for Communism builds in the US, and the result is a reactionary police-state.   The entire world becomes totalitarian. 

If Hitler dies at some point after becoming Fuhrer but before the war and the Holocaust, Nazism as an ideology is never discredited.   It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades.   Or, even after Nazi Germany's defeat, the Nazi party continues to exist as a strong political force in Germany because since Hitler dies before the fall of Nazism, Neo-Nazis can go around saying things about how the Nazis went astray, and how Hitler wouldn't have let the Holocaust happen, etc.  As an ideology, Nazism needs to die discredited with Hitler.

It should be noted that he never had any officer training. He was only ever a corporal.

Despite that, he had the audacity to make himself the supreme military commander and frequently ignore the advice of his generals.

He was the opposite of Stalin. As the war went on Stalin kept giving more and more power to other people, but Hitler kept firing generals and consolidating power. While I can't imagine a world where Nazi Germany actually accomplishes its goal of a total soviet defeat and a complete annexation of Russia and the baltic nations, I can't help but feel like were Hitler to just completely stay out of the actual war and remain a figurehead things would have gone in a *significantly* different direction.

> Not letting Rommel retreat in North Africa

Wouldn't have made a big difference to the war effort.

> invading Russia without winter clothes for the wermacht

Winter gear would have had to have been manufactured. The timing of Barbarossa was timed to be optimal for the invasion (and it actually was), so any delays would doom it beforehand, since the USSR was only getting stronger. One concern was that since they'd have to supply the winter gear *after* the invasion had begun, it would demoralize the men who were now aware that their leadership did not expect the war to be over by Christmas.

> directing the battle of Britain against London instead of the RAF

Many of the RAF bases were outside of the range of the Luftwaffe.

EDIT: If you're going to downvote, bother to respond with which that you disagree. Perhaps you think that the Desert Fox' campaign actually has significant besides being an entertaining sideshow to both the British and Hitler? Perhaps you think that the Luftwaffe *almost* defeated the RAF? (it didn't). Perhaps you think that Germany just had millions of units of winter gear sitting around (it didn't)? Choices in war aren't always as simple as 'we need this and this and let's add this!' -- if that were the case, Germany clearly should have entered the war equipped with PzkwIIIs, aircraft carriers, and let's just throw Me262s on there for good measure. Wartime manufacturing capabilities are delegated out because *they have to be*, regardless of country. Nobody has infinite manufacturing capacity nor resources (well, other than the US relative to anyone else in WW2 - the American industrial potential was staggering compared to all their opponents and even potential opponents (the USSR) *combined*), Germany already had manpower issues by 1941, and they frankly didn't have the manufacturing capacity to produce winter gear *en masse* at the time, and not without delaying the invasion until next summer *at the very least*, which would have doomed the operation to complete failure. The USSR, after 1941, was rearming *faster* than Germany was producing new military equipment. Let that sink in. The USSR is stronger relative to Germany in 1942 than they were in 1941. Strategically, Germany didn't have a choice in the matter (and isn't perfect hindsight grand?) as to when to invade, *if* they were going to invade (relations had strained between Germany and the USSR since late 1940, and war was likely inevitable by 1941).

Youre just looking for an argument arent you? Because id say 90% of that video was filmed outside, you know a place completely irrelevant to where fire safety measures would be implemented. Sure he caught video of retards using pyrotechnics in an obviously overcrowded indoor facility which led to the building being burned down. To say that alone led to the "widespread tightening of fire safety measures" is a bit of a stretch. Its pretty common sense to not use fire in a small indoor venue, and venue capacity limitations arent exactly new. I mean what purpose does the video serve after he gets out of the venue? To show the impending doom? To hear the people dying? And 'locked doors'? Have you even seen this video? Theres literally a pile of people fighting for a single inch at the doorway. People are jumping out of windows. What some of those people would have done for an extra hand to drag them a few extra feet out the door, i cant even imagine. And he just films them. To even suggest he is in any danger compared to the people trapped in the doorway, is not just ignorant, but stupid.

Man you really are fucking clueless. Go watch the video. Id say the people helping are helping more than they are hurting. Blocking the doorway? Like its not blocked with a pile of bodies who are clambering to get out? The danger is in that doorway, the danger would be released if people moved, people would move if they could, people need help to get unstuck... if you fail to see the sequence of events there, maybe you should go back to your moms uterus.

The video shows people trying to help which is more than you can ask for in that situation. Its easy for me, as someone watching the video from the safety of my home, to say 'I would have done this or that'. Though, I cant ever picture myself videotaping an incident in which 100 people are dying right in front of me and I cant give a helping hand to a single one of them. Instead I envision myself outside that door, grabbing people by whatever clothing or limb that i could get a hold of and dragging them out as forcefully as possible. I think its pretty appalling that some of the comments responding to me, would rather he videotaped the incident than save a life.

Its actually closer to truth, multiple planes were shot down in raids on that island, G H W Bush was the one that was picked up. Not sure if it was all in one raid, or separate ones though there was a book sourced from war crimes transcripts and surviving japanese veterans stationed on the island: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyboys:_A_True_Story_of_Courage

Not bullshit. Read Flyboys by James Bradley. One of those crewmen, Marve Mershon, was taken prisoner and executed. When the Japanese soldiers realized they didn't have enough meat for their dinner that night, they exhumed his body and cut out his liver and some flesh from his thigh and cooked it.

There were multiple planes that were shot down.  Not just Bush's.  Another crazy part of the story is when one plane got hit and the pilot thought it was going down, so he ordered his men to evacuate and parachute down.  After they jumped however, the pilot was able to regain control of his plane and limp back to his carrier.  The crew who bailed out of his plane were captured, executed, and eaten.  Talk about some guilty feelings for the pilot.

Yea I just commented on that. There were only 3 total. No one knows what happened to the other 2. Cannibalism of Flyboys consisted mainly of torture and then at times eating their livers to 'gain their strength'. Flyboys were detested due to their very successful bombing campaigns.

Bush was shot down in a 3 seater. And yes he was prisoner on that island. But it wasn't his crew, it was a total of 8 other POW's that had their livers eaten.

Yes the OP was mistaken. There were several planes that were shot down over the island over about a week that this happened to. If you would like to read a great book on the subject I would recommend Flyboys by James Bradley.

Well, NONE OF THEM could eject because this was an Avenger. And there were other aircraft too, but I believe the term you were looking for was "Bail out" but then again that is unlikely since there were three of them all captured. This means that they most likely had to ditch.

Just my 2 cents.

"In a global context, a 2005 Sex Survey of 317,000 people in 41 countries conducted by Durex, the largest condom manufacturer in the world, found that the Japanese had the least sex in the world, at 45 times a year, with the second-to-last country of Singapore averaging 73 times a year, and the world average at 103 times a year. Additionally the survey reported that only 24% of Japanese respondents said they were happy with their sex lives, compared to the global average of 44%."

If I remember correctly, it was Hitler who recognised the man in a painting and said something like, "that man was so close to killing me, I thought I'd never see Germany again". 
But it's possible that Hitler said that just to further imply that he was ment to survive and fulfil his objectives.

Quite possibly. There would have been no massive push for nuclear weaponry so wars would still be rife, Europe would not have unified which in turn drastically affected world peace.

There's this old thing that Christians used to post a lot about some kid in school who argued with a teacher and "proved the existence of God" and it ends with "That student's name? Albert Einstein." even though it never really happened. I'll see if I can find it.

*edit: found it*

> The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists?  A student bravely replied, "Yes, he did!"

>"God created everything? The professor asked. 

>"Yes sir", the student replied. 

>The professor answered, "If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth.

>Another student raised his hand and said, "Can I ask you a question professor?" 

>"Of course", replied the professor. 

>The student stood up and asked, "Professor, does cold exist?" 

>"What kind of question is this?  Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?" The students snickered at the young man's question.

>The young man replied, "In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."

>The student continued, "Professor, does darkness exist?"  

>The professor responded, "Of course it does."

>The student replied, "Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is?  You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."

>Finally the young man asked the professor, "Sir, does evil exist?"  

>Now uncertain, the professor responded, "Of course as I have already said. We see it every day.  It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil."

>To this the student replied, "Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light."

>The professor sat down.

>The young man's name — Albert Einstein.

Wikipedia has a reputation of being this awesome open place where anyone can edit, which was the case several years ago, but these days, it's ["The encyclopedia that anyone who understands the norms, socializes him or herself, dodges the impersonal wall of semi-automated rejection and still wants to voluntarily contribute his or her time and energy can edit.”](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/520446/the-decline-of-wikipedia/).

While estimates vary, 900 to 1000 Japanese soldiers entered the swamps. 500 of them got out. The large number of casualties is attributed to several things: fatigue, malnourishment, tropical diseases and other creatures lurking in the swamps (insects and snakes).

The average human reaction time is 0.225 seconds, approximately. At least if I remember correctly.

So probably nothing. In the time it would take for your brain to process what's going on, the heat has already sterilised your neurons, the pressure has totally broken down the structure of your brain and all brain activity would have ceased.

I can't be bothered to find sources, but whenever this incident pops up someone usually says the documentation of radiation was faulty and the radiation levels may not have even been abnormal. I've also seen people suggest it would be normal for people laying in reflective snow in the sun for a while

There was a [Cracked article](http://www.cracked.com/article_16671_6-famous-unsolved-mysteries-with-really-obvious-solutions.html) on this awhile back.

A detail the /u/prisoner216 left out was that many of the bodies were found naked.  Believe it or not, it all explains away pretty nicely.  The scattered bodies and broken limbs are, as /u/blaghart explained, easily explained by an avalanche and its aftermath.  The missing soft tissue was likely consumed by a scavenging animal (since this happened up in the mountains, the bodies were preserved by the cold, so there was plenty to time between the incident and its discovery).  The naked bodies were likely a result of [Paradoxical Undressing,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxical_undressing#Paradoxical_undressing) a documented phenomenon where hypothermia victims remove their own clothing.  There was no evidence of radiation onsite, and was likely an embellishment added later.

There was a very small amount of radiation actually recorded, equal to what they would've been exposed to with the equipment they were using.  The radiation was exaggerated in later accounts to make it more interesting.

Indeed. Avalanche explanation alone does't hold any water, and people don't care enough to question it or investigate. It could have been a fear of avalanche + stupid actions + internal conflicts in the group, but this case is definitely not so simple as cracked painted it.

If you dig you can find the actual autopsies online. Dubinina's upper lip was apparently damaged, and all of her nose cartilage was gone, as well.

Obviously they left after the avalanche occurred.  They were in the tent, it was hit by an avalanche, they tore it open and ran out in a panic.  Look at the pictures, it looks exactly like a tent that had been hit with a huge wall of snow.

There wasn't any. The findings of radiation weren't in the reports until quite a few years after the incident. It's pretty much just an easily explainable accident that people have turned into something more. :)

Clothes weren't off, mostly. Two of them were partly undressed which is no mystery: others took their clothes when they died. Some had no footwear, probably because they were sitting in the tent, and then had to leave in a hurry.

The skin color is apparently not a major mystery either.

But there [was radiation](https://sites.google.com/site/hibinaud/home/zaklucenie-eksperta).

The avalanche made them abandon the tent while underdressed.  The hypothermia caused the paradoxal undressing.

They fled their tent with no clothes, which is in keeping with hypothermia.  Hypothermia fucks with your brain something fierce, meaning that you feel very hot and are likely to disrobe and wander off.

Which is in keeping with an avalanche.  The snow moves like a wave and settles out, then the blizzard blows all the snow away, exposing them to the elements.  Couple that with the fact that the survivors were clearly exposed to the cold since they wandered off in a hypothermic state and you have your explanation.

Hypothermia induces a state wherin you feel very, very, very hot.  Which is why they abandoned their clothes (can't remember the name of the condition atm, but doubtlessly it's on wiki)  Also I don't recall there being evidence of which way the tent was torn, considering avalanches do tend to send things rather everywhere.

In the original reports, only trace amounts of radiation were observed, exactly what they would've been exposed to with the equipment they were using.  It was only in later reports that it became exaggerated.  Read the Wiki, it's all right there.

There [was definitely cannibalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Donner_Party#Claims_of_cannibalism). The book they talk about in the wiki really goes into detail about it. I went to a talk recently about women pioneers in the area, and the speaker pointed out how odd it is that there's a picnic area there. I'd never thought about it until then, and we definitely stopped for lunch there when I was a kid at least once.

A lot of these technological bounds were occurring/ had been occurring on the other side of the atlantic.  

> atomic and modern physics

Atomic - America only made advancements (proper advancements) in this when Scientists from Europe, who felt persecuted by the nazis, left and to get as far away as they could they went to the USA. 

Modern Physics - Again much more was being done in Europe than in the US. 

> civil engineering/infrastructure

See: Germany (1930-45), UK, France...  

> IBM was doing some interesting work in the first half of the century

IBM was dealing in general electronic goods and punch card machines. The real advancements were being done in UK, France and Germany. IBM expanded (then focused solely on) computing once the war was over and America had, frankly, stolen the European computing technologies. 

A lot of the things you believe the US was number 1 at are simply because the institutions in which to pursue these sciences were more numerous. But Quantity != Quality. 

> aeronautical design

Even thinking of this, better ships were being built in the German and Royal Navy. Germany had the best submarines in the world. And Britain had the best architects. They got on a roll after the invention of the dreadnought which reshaped modern ship building for the foreseeable future. 

Planes too! German and British planes were incredibly efficient. A lot of technologies for these planes were simply sold to America. E.g. Radar and Bubble cockpits.

The word "Croatoan" is an alternate spelling for the Croatan tribe of native Americans. Croatoan did later become the name of what is now Hatteras Island, the location of Cape Hatteras, NC. The fact that the word refers to the tribe, which was friendly and traded with colonists, further goes to support the idea of assimilation. I live on the NC coast, so this mystery has always fascinated me.

I work in behavioral health, and last year I went to a conference where the keynote speaker was the Unabomber's brother. He told his story, the slow realization he had that the letters the Unabomber were sending out sounded like his brother, coming to terms with the fact that your brother isn't just an eccentric genius but a mentally ill murderer. The brother and wife would get these post cards from Ted, from his cabin the in woods, he talked about their gradual descent into madness. They were always trying to get him to come back home, Ted always refused. If the brother tried to challenge this thinking (or approach to the worlds problems), Ted would stop writing for a while. When the media started posting the letters that went along with the bombs, at first the brother was in denial. But his wife kept pointing out similarities... He didn't take him long to contact the FBI. 

He talked about turning him in, and the aftermath with the media hounding him and his family. Their mother was still alive, and while she agreed that her son was probably the Unabomber she was furious with the brother for turning him in. 

He still tries to see Ted in prison, Ted always refuses. It was an absolutely fascinating human element to a very sad story.

Random fact: Freshman year in college my roommate had to read the Unabomber manifesto for a class (circa 1998).

His reflects seems quite relevant to where we're current at: "technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom", "while technological progress AS A WHOLE continually narrows our sphere of freedom, each new technical advance CONSIDERED BY ITSELF appears to be desirable."

A [local radio station](http://kdhx.org) played some of his earlier stuff a few years back. There was a lot of "red scare" propaganda hinting that you should turn your neighbors in ( it turns out he was rubbing elbows with J Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy). Then there was another one where he went on an angry racist diatribe about how poor people were the ones who responsible for the terrible shape that the country was in.  Then the one that really sent me over the top , he was urging his listeners to send money to Billy Graham.

Shortly after changing my opinion on him being a good guy, I read an article where Jan Harold Brunvand (from big book of urban legends) was accusing Harvey of just making shit up on his "rest of the story" show.

>TL;DR - Scopolamine is a drug that has only criminal use. It is used to rob, rape or kill. It is so potent, that airborne particles can put you under its influence. While under the influence you will listen to anyone's suggestions, you may even go out of your way to help them. To outsiders, it is almost impossible to tell that someone is on Scopolamine.

Your TL;DR is misleading, especially saying that it has only criminal use. Source, RN. Allow me to explain. 

This drug is a muscarinic antagonist. So, its similar to atropine. My source for this information is Pharmacology for Nursing Care, by Richard A. Lehne. Sixth Edition. 

Muscarinic antagonists as a class of drug block the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, the majority of which are found on structures innervated by parasympathetic nerves. So, when you block these nerves you are essentially blocking the effects of the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). The normal effects of the PSNS are 'rest and digest'. It constricts the pupils, increases blood flow to GI tract, shunts blood away from skeletal muscle, increases smooth muscle contraction in the GI tract, decreases heart rate etc. You could think of it as the opposite of the Fight or Flight response, which is what the Sympathetic Nervous System does. (Not certain your level of education, so to be fair, this is being boiled down quite a bit, you could have a PhD in something for all I know.) However, blocking the PSNS does not necessarily mean that the person will exhibit a sympathetic, or Fight or Flight, response. 

pp 129
Scopolamine is an anticholinergic drug antagonist with actions much like those of atropine, but with two exceptions. 1) ...therapeutic doses of atropine produce mild CNS (central nervous system) excitation (agitation etc), therapeutic doses of Scopolamine produce sedation. 2) Scopolamine suppresses emesis (vomiting) and motion sickness, whereas Atropine does not. 

Scopolamine is also used for production of preanesthetic sedation and obstetric amnesia. However this is a different dose. It is used to prevent profound bradycardia, as well as to dry up respiratory secretions. (To be fair, I am not a CRNA, but I believe Atropine is used more commonly). It is however, also used for post-operative nausea and vomiting. However, in my time in the PACU, I never used it, I only ever saw decadron and other medications used for this. So I believe it is uncommonly used for this.

So to say that it has no use apart from criminal is incorrect. 

This medication is very commonly prescribed for nausea, vomiting, motion sickness etc. Especially outside of the US, where it is known sometimes as Buscopan. 

In your defense however, it can be abused, much like any drug. In the event that someone was given a very high dose of this medication however, it can cause delirium and symptoms of psychosis. It has been used in the past for purposes of interrogation. 

I doubt that people under the influence of this drug act normally to the point where it is impossible to tell if someone is under the influence of the medication. However, this is in the realm of controlled production of it, so its possible the non-controlled version mentioned in the video is different, though I suspect they mix it with something else.

Not actually true..

But we are descendents of 10K individuals that were the sole survivors of a natural catastrophe 70Kyears ago.

We share many of the same relatives because of how our or family ties work.
We have 4 grandparents, 8 great grandparents, 16 great great grandparents etc.

Basically doubling each generation.

So if you keep counting backwards you end up with millions of grandparents you descend from in only a few hundreds of years.

If you consider that human kind had far less individuals back then, you end up sharing most of your great great great ... grandparents with your friends.

Even for yourself probably in those millions most of them were the same individuals just repeated a few times.

Yes.

The Japanese built their industries right up next to their housing.  You'll also rarely hear people complain about Operation Gomorrah or Operation Meetinghouse, although those killed just as many people in a worse way, took place in advance of the deployment of the A-Bombs, and paved the way for their acceptance.

Also, the uranium based bomb was never tested.  We were certain it would work.  It's not a complex design.  We tested the Nagasaki design at Trinity because it's more complex, but more efficient.  All modern nukes use some form of the Nagasaki design somewhere in their operation.

> the Japanese were willing to surrender so long as they kept the emperor,

Actually, the army commanders wanted a few other things things; among those were the right to put their own war criminals on trial, a minimal occupation force, and the right to disband their own troops.


> Suzuki, Togo, and Yonai favored acceptance of the Allied ultimatum with the single proviso relating to the Imperial polity. The other three--War Minister Anami and the two Chiefs of Staff, Umezu for the Army and Toyoda for the Navy--wanted to propose conditions: a minimal occupation force, trying of war criminals by Japan rather than by the enemy, and demobilization of Japanese troops by Japanese officers. Anami and the two Chiefs of Staff were unable, apparently, to accept the idea of either defeat or surrender, both of which went against all their training; these proposals, thus, were aimed at minimizing, perhaps even denying, the fact of both defeat and surrender.

Except that in the citation you just provided, it discusses of the Japanese were primarily discussing with the Soviets (who had no real intention of honoring a peace, rather just using it as a breather before they invaded manchuria, korea, and even Hokaido) and then it mentions that the Japanese werent even sure if the Soviets were in discussion with the rest of the allies about the possible surrender, and goes on to say how the Japanese dismissed the Potsdam declaration. 

Then if you read the rest of the citation, you see that after Hiroshima was bombed, and Manchuria was invaded by the Soviets, the Japanese cabinet was having a meeting about surrendering, and in the middle of that meeting is when Nagasaki was bombed. Soooo....yea....

Also what would have been preferable to you? The planned invasion of Japan which would have killed far more people? The soviet invasion of Japan which would have resulted in Japan no longer being a sovereign nation and probably result in far more civilian deaths (The Soviets werent known for their kindness when invading other countries)

Also I dont know where you're from, but dont act like the United States is the only country thats ever done anything thats resulted in the loss of innocent life. Fuck Imperial Japan during WW2 is a great example, after the shit like The Rape of Nanking (which alone resulted in more casualties than both of the atomic bombings), Unit 371, the 2.1 million Chinese civilians they killed. Basically what Im saying is that I have no sympathy for Imperial Japan, and I find it somewhat hypocritical that everyone can be so critical of the United States for dropping those two bombs, yet no one seems to care anymore about all the atrocities that Imperial Japan committed at that time.

The only reason they didn't test it before Hiroshima is because they considered it such a simple bomb that they could just test the components and know that the explosion was a sure thing.

From your link:
>While testing of the components was conducted,[12] no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissionable material, and took place on July 16, 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 as compared with the relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors.[14] **Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly.** Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.[15]

I don't think you're reading what he's saying right. A secondary function of dropping the nuclear bombs was to show the communists that the Americans were not afraid to use the bomb. In fact, they did it without the knowledge of the Russians, one reason to spark the Cold War.

False.  The Trinity Test near Alamogordo, New Mexico was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon.  It was conducted on July 16, roughly 3 weeks before Fat Man ravaged Nagasaki.

You logic is sound. But, they didn't react that way. 

First bomb dropped. Japan poker faced it for 3 days. Then they held a meeting to discuss surrender, which ended before news of the second bombing even reached them.

If it was really such a big deal, why would they wait 3 days? They still had 4 million troops poised to defend the homeland from US invasion. The object of the game was not to win, but to make the casualty count so high, we'd say "fuck it" and give them some bargaining options on the surrender table.

The game changer was Russia. When they invaded the largely undefended western side, the game was up. The bomb provided a scape goat for the empire domestically, and handed "war ending power" over to the US. 

We knocked out most of Japans cities in a single summer. If that didn't prompt a surrender, I doubt 1 more city would, regardless of what kind of bomb was used.

Yes. The ballistics are explained much better (basically perfectly) if the shot came from the agent riding behind him. One thing that makes the ballistics funky in general is that JFK's seats in the car weren't at the same height as the row that the Texas gov. was sitting in (I think JFK's were lower, kind of like the interior of the car was scooped out). 

I would say that the second bullet doesn't really have an exit wound per se, only because it resulted in about a quarter of his skull blowing off. This is actually one of the facts that never lined up all that well with the official report; the first bullet (the one traditionally called "the magic bullet") traveled through JFK's neck, the car seats, and then the Texas governor's back and front before finally lodging in his wrist, which it shattered. This pass-through trajectory is consistent with a full metal jacket type of bullet. The fatal shot, however, was more like a hollow point bullet, which expands/explodes on impact. 

It's obviously not impossible that LHO used totally different rounds in his rifle, but it seems a little off. The agent in the car behind JFK, however, was seen sweeping an AR-15 (which had just been introduced into the Secret Service's arsenal) in the immediate aftermath of the first shot, a weapon that was loaded with hollow points. 

Additionally, x-rays of the President's brain showed tens of small objects arrayed around the entry wound of the second shot consistent with the fragments of a hollow point bullet. These were confiscated by the Secret Service (with a promise that they'd be returned after the Agency made copies) but never seen again. There are several other factual or circumstantial oddities that convincingly (IMO) begin to make sense if you operate from the assumption that JFK was accidentally shot by an agent in the car behind him (I can go into those a bit if you'd like btw).

In a less specific way, I find this explanation to be very tidy for everything that happened. Like, yes, there was a big cover-up, but there was no preexisting conspiracy or shadowy cabal. It was the Secret Service covering up a horrible and tragic mistake, and there's so much crap that's just plain weird (like, where is his brain?!?!) because they were flying by the seat of their pants. Jack Ruby was just a nutcase. LHO didn't follow up one great shot with a second impossibly great shot. Then it was pretty much "in for a penny, in for a pound," we have a dead shooter, case closed. It just kinda feels right to me; I dunno that I'm convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, but I'm definitely convinced with a "preponderance of the evidence" standard.

There is no way that was accidental. A popular theory is that the Chinese got a hold of a downed jet and kept it hidden in the embassy for future transportation.   The US did not want their jet design being stolen, so they resorted to bombing the embassy.

A F117 was shot down 5 weeks earlier. Maybe the Chinese received some gifts from Serbia and kept them in the embassy.

Other sources say the embassy was used as a relay sender for the Serbian army or the Chinese monitored the cruise missile attacks to develop counter measures.

---

On May 7, 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (Operation Allied Force), five US JDAM bombs hit the People's Republic of China embassy in the Belgrade district of New Belgrade, killing three Chinese reporters and outraging the Chinese public. President Bill Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental. Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet testified before a congressional committee that the bombing was the only one in the campaign organized and directed by his agency. The Chinese government maintains that the bombing was a deliberate act and has always regarded the entire Kosovo operation as an illegal war by NATO.

Yeah, but that guy might not have ordered a genocide, or had some fucked up beliefs on Aryan masterhood. He might have even been a nice guy who went fascist to build Germany back up after WWI and not started WW2 as soon as things got going good again.

On the flip side, Germany would likely still be a fairly fascist state had WW2 not happened, and much of Europe would likely be much more conservative politically. Things like universal healthcare might not exist, or be decades behind where they are now.

Perhaps, but there's no denying how much more we could learn if we just said "fuck it" to ethics. There's a lot of hoops you've got to jump through currently, and the data isn't as clear cut as it would be if we just hurt a few test subjects along the way.

That is essentially indentured servitude.  So yes, some people (and most certainly not only Africans) did "sign up" for slavery.  Yes there were unscrupulous people who refused to honor the rules but there were many who did honor the rules.  Indentured servitude was a good way to cross oceans and start a new life for many immigrants.

TL;DR population estimated at up to 100 million when Columbus arrived, Europe's was 70 million. In between then and "proper" settlers arriving some time later, plague killed 96% of the population. Why do you think there is a ~hundred year gap of not much happening post 1492?

You'd be surprised. Hostile natives were why they restricted themselves to staying off the mainland, and eventually to only occasionally visiting to get timber from Markland. Hostile natives are one of the main reasons they didn't permanently colonise Vinland. Granted, there is also the fact that it was essentially a colony of a colony of a colony (Vinland and Markland were colonies of Greenland, itself a colony of Iceland, itself a mainly Norwegian Colony), and Greenland had a low population to begin with due to the hostile conditions. But the Inuit also helped drive them out of Greenland, so...

Simply put: I have science to counter it.

I'm not saying don't believe in what you believe. I'm saying that you have as many facts as I do. I'm not an Atheist. Hell, I'm not even an Agnostic. I'm a die-hard, ultra-religious Pagan woman. However, I honestly don't think that you should be forcing beliefs like that. Morally (or do you not believe in actual morality, where your actions are influenced purely out of the intent to help others with *no personal gain* [i.e. your Heaven and Hell]), it is wrong to say to people that your belief is what is right. You can live in harmony with people of other religions and not be a dick.

*First para from linked Wikipedia article [Blackstone Chronicles %28novel series%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone_Chronicles_%28novel_series%29):*

---

**The Blackstone Chronicles** is a serialized novel by American horror and suspense author John Saul. The series consists of six installments and takes place in a fictional New Hampshire town called Blackstone. The plot is that the old asylum is about to be demolished. In each chapter a different character receives a "gift" from an unknown source, and strange, terrible things begin to happen to the recipient (or those around them) shortly thereafter. The final novel reveals the connection between the various objects and the identity of the mysterious gift-giver.

Well, computer do exactly what you tell them to, so it is kind of the same in the sense that it can go bad pretty quickly. 

For example, when you tell a computer to copy a set of characters, like "hello" and you accidentally get the copy size off by one, so 4, you copy "hell" and corrupt the memory next to that with "o" which can be anything. It can be an instruction that jumps to the wrong memory and kills your CPU, it can be data that gets corrupted and something can get corrupted like your screen, etc.

"[her father] thought her sexuality was too intense and untempered by the moral strictures to which the other daughters had adhered."

and

"her behaviour grew increasingly volatile after 1939. There are stories of her smashing objects and even kicking her grandfather"

This was pre-WW2.  Our understanding and treatment of psychological issues at the time can be considered prehistoric compared to its current state.  Doctors then used lobotomies the way doctors used Ritalin in the 90's.

I didn't love Wolf of Wall St., but you can't deny Leo and Jonah Hill were both excellent in that movie. It's what made the 3 hours tolerable.  although it become more of a black comedy in the second half...you really sensed that in the qualude Lemon 714 scene.  

btw, I've actually had some of those genuine Lemon 714s. got them teh same way actually. a college buddy showed up with a bottle of them (this was in the early 90s). however, i'm sorry to report that the effect was the opposite. they got weaker over time.  i also once found a bunch of old morphine and dilaudids. the dilaudids (liquid and pills) had grown super weak but the morphine was still really good.

anyway, yeah, i love leo..in a hetero way..

This is correct.  While she did allegedly kill one person after another, in a series of murders, she does not fit with the standard connotations of a serial killer.  An executioner, for example, kills a series of people, but is not generally recognized to be a serial killer.  Here is a good rule of thumb; if someone is paying you to do it, congratulations you are the Zodiac.

I'm on my work computer and currently filling up any logs they have of me with terrible search history inquiries BUT I learned on this fine site in a TIL a while back that there was a Roman who trained animals to rape people.  And it wasn't just giraffes either.

IIRC, he would start the animals young at it and use either a scent put on the victim to get the animal going and when his career was done- instead of giving away all his secrets, he said it had to do with a special necklace or something that he had and I think he sold it- further fooling those who wanted to copy him.

I don't remember the story and after a few unsuccessful Google searches about "roman animals taught to rape"- I realize this is not what I want to come up in my search history or anywhere else for that matter on my work computer.

If you don't find anything yourself today- I'll try to search it out tonight.

it's not - this was actually a fairly common practice in rome with all animals, not just giraffes.

animals' sexuality function by way of olfactory (smelling) pheromones and the romans knew this (they were pretty smart, those romans). as such, they would take a female animal (in this instance, a giraffe) who was ripe for mating, and they would collect that animal's urine.

then, they'd take this pheromone sexpanther piss-perfume, and douse the human who was ripe for the raping in it before marching him/her out into the coliseum (or any amphitheater gladiator games took place at) naked, bent  over in doggy style position, and inhibit that person from moving.

finally, they would take sexually depraved male animal of the same genus, march that bad boy into the middle of the arena, and upon smelling the pheromones, it would charge into center stage and ram it's 3 foot long dong into whatever poor individual was drenched in said sexpanther.

the resulting sex would cause so much internal damage that the victim would almost die - usually from internal bleeding. eventually, the male animals did this so much it just became a matter of conditioning.

hormones are a hell of a drug. 

TL;DR - Romans were as fucked up as they were intelligent and this is a historical fact: animals were indeed trained to rape humans.

Problems with your statement of Locusta being a spree killer:

[Spree killer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_killer)
[Serial killer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer)

I link these with no intent to insult you, but so that we may begin our trains of thought on the same page.

Locusta certainly killed more than three people, and there was a 'Cooling off period' in her cycle. This cooling off period is mostly due to her imprisonment, but it is still present.

[Serial killers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer), by necessity, need what is called a 'cooling off period.' In Locusta's case, repeating the same method of murder as well as murdering more than the minimum of three individuals with cooling off periods inbetween settles her nicely into the 'Serial killer' category. She does not fit 'Mass murderer' as she did not kill a large amount of people in one sitting, nor does she fit 'Spree killer' as she did not kill regularly.

I also did a paper on it around the age of 14. It wasn't very long and I didn't read more than the normal stuff on wikipedia. It had no negative effect on me. My mind was a little dull because I've had some health issues, but I digested it and wasn't really thrown off by the facts of what happened. It was a grave war and I understood that things like these could happen in a situation like that. I kind of remember thinking I wouldn't want to see the infected flesh though, and I remember the mental image I had of a man in a cage getting his frozen arm hammered off him. Seemed pretty brutal, but not very offensive. Nightmares and unclean dreams are definitely worse, in my experience(for comparison)

Were there any sources, hopefully available online, to back the story up in the first place? Is the fact that it's published somewhere enough for you?

Maybe if it touched a chord in you, you could do some research on your own and share it with the class.

I get asking for sources, but I feel like comments like these can actually be incredibly low value for conversations, especially in threads like these that are just going to be full of anecdotes someone read once.

Ehhhh, I think it depends. Not ALL vivisection is sans anesthesia. There are many vivisections that go on in med schools. I had a professor talk of one he did on a dog that was drugged unconscious where he put his hand in the chest cavity and tried to stop the heart by squeezing it. He was unable to, if that means anything to anyone. The point is, maybe some of the vivisections mentioned were with living, kicking, screaming patients, etc... But not all in history are.

And Im not sure what you mean by "US not testifying at the Hague against Japan"?  The International Criminal Court wasn't in effect then. As for the charge of genocide, that was not codified into law until '48 either. So no one was charged with genocide in WW2, not even the Nazis.

Japanese war criminals were however prosecuted in the International Tribunal for the Far East. 

If you are sincerely interested, check out *Year Zero: A History of 1945* as it really explains how chaotic the postwar era was, no one had seen anything like this before, genocide had never really been defined and they really had no idea how to handle it.

So what you're saying is 'all you have to do is be ordered to experiment on humans by a megalomaniac dictator running a world power who tries and fails to take over the world, and you can get away with it!'

Somehow I don't feel like there will be a lot of people lining up to take advantage of that precedent.

And you utterly fail to acknowledge the other side of the coin: here we have data that in some cases could end up saving tens of thousands of lives over the next fifty years (before medical science becomes good enough to figure it out sans-vivisection. Remember, this isn't all about nerve gas etc, there is a remarkable amount of useful data.) Now that this data exists, you are arguing that the chance that some other group might believe that their similar activities — but not ones ordered by a sovereign power run by a criminal madman, because let's face it, if you torture enough doctors you can find some who will experiment for you anyway — won't be punished, is large enough, and the potential result awful enough, to condemn both the scientists *and* those tens of thousands of people to die, the latter simply so justice can be served on the former.

This is what you call 'looking at it from an ethical standpoint', is it?

There is a general misconception on the purpose of punishment (especially on reddit). Theory of criminal justice recognizes four purposes of punishment:

* Deterrent theory: prevention of other crimes being committed (because of the general fear of punishment).
* Retributive theory: the goal is to try to rebalance any unjust advantage gained by ensuring that the offender also suffers a loss. -> what you may call vengeance or lex talionis.
* Preventive theory: which is the protection of others from the offender.
* Reformative theory: the goal is to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct (correction of the penalised).

Punishment encompasses those four purposes all together. Every State choses to what extent they want to valorise each of them, but it is important to acknowledge that punishment includes all of them!

The medical information gained from those experiments absolutely improved our knowledge of the human body and how it functions, making new advances in medical treatment possible. So in an indirect way, yes those experiments did help people. That doesn't mean they were justified, but denying it is just being dishonest. A lot of what we know about hypothermia and pressure on the body came from those experiments.

The police held him up because they thought he put the bomb on himself, that there were no kidnappers making him do it, and that he would never detonate it. They didn't know then about the accomplices. In any case, it was a stupid plan because they were idiots, not experts. I doubt they would have thought that far ahead.

No it's textbook narcissistic sociopathy. It's way beyond greed. It seems to me he was pissed at a perceived slight from the town's people (probably being rejected personally and/or his political ideas being rejected- narcissists have a hard time believing their ideas are fallable which can lead to misanthropic feelings when they're rejected by others) and had decided he had lost too much of his status in life (lost election, terminal wife, maybe other unknown issues) to want to continue living. So instead of committing suicide quietly, he decides to 'give those fuckers what they deserve' and to do it on such a scale as bring some serious notoriety to himself and his ideas. I blame the victims for making me do this- its the classic narcissistic antisocial bully. This is probably what's behind most school shooting type scenarios.

PoCo is serviced by the RCMP though and the Highway of Tears team, established in 2005 (a couple of years after the Pickton excavations ended and just before trial began) [is run out of the lower mainland.](http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/12/28/bc_highway_of_tears_rcmp_accused_of_not_taking_womens_disappearances_seriously.html)

The specific shuffling of police claim is one I heard from a professor that was heavily involved in activism around the Highway when I lived up north. They were particularly concerned that several investigators with in-depth knowledge of the cases had been yanked to focus on Pickton. I wish I could provide more substantive information than that.

I don't know much besides that. My uncle's mother gave him to my grandparents when he was a baby, because  she was a drug addict and could not care for him. She moved to Vancouver after that, or at least she told them,  and they never saw or heard from them again. We were living in a small town in the west kootenays. Her remains were among those found on picktons farm, my uncle was inhis early twenties and I was quite young when he went to the trial. I didn't have any first hand experience with it, just what he told me when I was a bit older.

I'm not sure that would provide a lot of info for anyone, my uncle didn't know much about his mother and was contacted through extended family he had not met before going to the trial. It's quote painful for him to talk about, he only knew his mother as a murder victim so I could imagine he would not be interested. There were so many families affected and more closely connected to the trials that could probably be willing and more able to provide information, I would even be interested in an ama from someone like that. I'm sure If you made an ama request someone would answer. Picktons trial and conviction was something that shook the province, it was huge, especially for the communities located around highway 16, the lower mainland and the southern interior. Since a lot of people used him as an example of what happens to hitch hikers especially since the towns are spread so far apart, even though i dont think all of his victims were taken whilst on the highway. Hitchhiking is illegal and strictly enforced still in most of the province.

Not saying that there isn't plenty of evidence that runs contrary to the theory, but it isn't a hypothesis. The event occurred and now you're weighing the amount of effect it had. Something bottlenecked the population and that could have been any number of things, true. It just happens to be that this event occurs at about exactly the same time. The largest super eruption in the last 2.5 million years.

We didn't survive because we invented forks or some shit, we survived because we were the only ones that had the necessary combination of ingenuity and cooperation to survive. Those two traits also eventually led to forks. And space shuttles.

However, like any theory about shit that happened tens of thousands of years ago, there is some debate about it. None of the debate says that no bottlenecking occurred, as far as I'm aware, it just centers around exactly how much of our current traits we can credit to that bottleneck.

70,000 years ago is recent enough that humans were already fairly global. 
As for the far-reaching extent of the eruption, consider the eruption a few years ago of that Icelandic volcano; it shut down air traffic across much of Europe, and the eastern coast of North America, and that eruption was only a small percentage of the effect of the one OP mentioned.

It's pretty amazing what an eruption can do to the earth.  It's also worth mentioning that we aren't talking about a regular volcanic eruption such as the one in Iceland a few years ago or Mt. St. Helens.  We're talking super-volcano status eruption.

The gasp reflex won't be triggered underwater. It is specific to a situation with an unobstructed mouth.

Holding your breath, for a sufficient amount of time, will usually end with gasping for air. If your mouth happens to be covered, you shouldn't trigger a gasp reflex.

I was unable to pull a good source, but did attempt to confirm it by self experimentation.

Exactly.  I had a friend do it one time just for the hell of it, not full blown, just like water on the face with a cloth covering.  I lasted like 3 seconds because that diving reflex kicked in and it was fuuuuucked up.  Give it a try.  It's not like it's going to scar you for life, it's just surprising how effective it is.  Get a t-shirt or something, put it over your face, and have someone pour a bucket of water over it slowly.  Try to hold your breath :)

Not necessarily, I misspoke a little.  It's an overreaction of the mammalian diving reflex, often caused by stress.  So maybe if you were walking along a boat and suddenly in cold water it might happen, but it isn't 100%.

Just to freak you out again it relatively common for the throat to remain closed even when the person is pulled from the water. So you have to wait until the muscles relax before pushing air into them will work in CPR

Actually water filling your lungs is pretty peaceful.  The urge to breathe is caused by buildup of carbon dioxide in your blood, not by lack of oxygen.  Water in your lungs means that you're still getting rid of carbon dioxide.  So you wouldn't feel much urge to breathe after the initial shock.  Then it's all peaceful, straight to the grave.

Cold water drowning with your throat closing would mean you're panicking and flailing in abject horror for a few minutes as it felt like your chest and face were on fire.

Two ways you can die.  Buildup of carbon dioxide is what causes the urge to breathe like when you hold your breath, and if you can't get it out of your blood, it can acidify your blood and kill you...but that's more of a long term thing (>10 minutes).  Lack of oxygen is what normally would kill you, as it would usually take less than ten minutes...cold water increases that time somewhat, but that still kills you faster.

It's an overreaction of the diving reflex, stress seems to make it more common.  Like most people don't get it just from swimming in cold water, but are way more likely to get it if suddenly thrown overboard into it.

Stress is a part of it.  It isn't EXACTLY part of the diving reflex, more of an overreaction by the body.  So them telling you to cover your mouth made it less stressful because it wasn't entirely uncharted territory, so to speak.

A lot of muscles stay contracted after you die.  Like if someone dies grasping something you might well have to break their fingers to get it out of their grasp.  Eventually it would relax, but it would take a while.

I'm sure it's been featured on crime shows before.

Another interesting fact: If you inhale some water and later take a nap, the water that hasn't cleared out of your lungs yet can still drown you.

Not necessarily.  A lot of reflexes are independent of the brain.  The idea behind reflexes is that they're a lot faster if it's nerve to spine and back to muscle rather than nerve to spine to brain to spine to muscle.

A lot of people find drowning to be quite peaceful after the initial 'oh shit I'm drowning' response wears off.  The urge to breathe (like when you hold your breath and feel that stress/tension telling you to breathe) is actually caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, rather than a lack of oxygen.  If there's water in your lungs, the carbon dioxide can still dissolve out, but you don't really get any oxygen.

However, if your throat had closed, it'd be a gasping/clawing/stressful death more than likely as the carbon dioxide couldn't escape.

Interestingly, a lot of people with breathing problems don't die from lack of oxygen, they die because they can't get the carbon dioxide out of their blood well enough and it turns acidic.

*First para from linked Wikipedia article [Mammalian diving reflex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_diving_reflex):*

---

The **mammalian diving reflex** is a reflex in mammals which optimizes respiration to allow staying underwater for extended periods of time. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins, etc.), but exists in a weaker version in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. Every animal's diving reflex is triggered specifically by cold water contacting the face – water that is warmer than 21 °C (70°F) does not cause the reflex, and neither does submersion of body parts other than the face. Also, the reflex is always exhibited more dramatically, and thus can grant longer survival, in young individuals.

I think the technical term for it is laryngospasm.  It tends to happen more often when someone is stressed/shocked whenever they enter the water.  It can happen in warm water too, but is much much more common in cold water.  It's part of an overreaction of the diving reflex, rather than being a part of it functioning normally.  It can actually be triggered just by washing your face with cold water.

Heh no.  You ever see in movies where someone dies and they're holding something?  Sometimes people can hold something so tightly that you'd have to break their fingers off to get the object out of their grasp.  There's a lot of weird reflexes and stuff that don't necessarily let go if they're engaged when you die.

He was known to suffer chronic indigestion after the 1914 atempt on his life. Both his daughter and his former secretary claimed that because of this he would not eat such sugary items as those offered. One of the conspirators even said in their statement to the police that Rasputin did not eat the food that was offered and that is why they shot him.

There are a few different types of dry drowning. The one I know most about is 'laryngospasm' which is common with GERDs (gastroesophageal reflux disease). As soon as your voice box or the area of the windpipe below the voicebox detect the entry of water or other liquid, the vocal folds spasm shut. The lack of oxygen causes hypoxia, and the increased carbon dioxide causes acidosis. I don't think laryngospasm is often fatal but it certainly can be.

A guy higher up explained it... mammals have a reflex to close off their airway when the face is submerged in cold water, so if you're alive before being thrown into the water, you still suffocate from lack of oxygen, but you don't inhale water because your airway was sealed at the time of death

The only 'solid' fact is, there was no poison in his system. 

2 people who knew him claimed he wouldn't have eaten the food. One of the co-conspirators said he didn't eat it which is why they were forced to shoot him. The other co-conspirators claimed he ate the food but didn't die because he was some kind of monster. 

The poison may have been ruined by the cooking or he may not have eaten it but either way he certainly wasn't poisoned by it.

There is more than one kind of dry drowning. You are talking about laryngospasm, which can occur with little or no water actually entering the lungs. People who suffer from GERD tend to get frequent, generally non-fatal, attacks of laryngospasm.

Other causes of dry drowing include exposure to gases such as methane, muscular paralysis and hyponatraemia. Carbon monoxide poisoning could also be considered 'dry drowning'.

Actually, I found that halfway through the game, the scares stopped and it became more of a sequence of "walk, look around, walk, look around, shit, hide, walk some more." 
 
No more scares, just hiding. Although that mission in the red-misted ancient Mesoamerican ruins under the castle (?) was quite menacing

[This is the location of the airbase that the article states they were flying to.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Guerir_Air_Base) There was no need to fly over the Med to get there from Florida.

One of the sources of the article states their destination as "undisclosed" and that they refuelled once over the Azores, and were due to refuel again off the coast of Algeria.

It just seem's highly unlikely that Morocco was their destination. They'd be flying a significant distance out of there way to refuel when they were almost there.

Mostly Atlantic, but a part of it's coast is in the Mediterranean.

(As I'm sure you already know, being way closer to the situation than I am)...
North Korea is a difficult situation. A lot of people there are brought into the Kim's enforced cult of personality, and we know very little about its internal structure. South Korea alone could invade, but this would anger not only North Korea, but also China - a force much too large for South Korea to fight alone. This means that South Korea needs support from a better equipped nation. America is a long-time ally of South Korea, and, as such, is the natural choice. Now, if America went in, then China would react even more aggressively, and Russia may even become involved. Now we have a three-way war by proxy between three of the world's biggest superpowers (and throw in their allies, for good measure).
Why would China defend the North? They wouldn't. They would, however, defend the presence of a communist buffer zone between themselves and the US-backed South Korea. If the US and South Korea successfully push north, and unify all of Korea under the South's government, then China is living next door to America's buddy. China doesn't want that.
Any sort of large-scale collapse of North Korea will lead to long-term instability and a vacuum with three or four major players trying desperately to get in first.

Why not just take out the Kims? Simply put, then we have an internal power struggle. The generals and higher-ups in the military will want to take it for themselves. The only viable solution is for the regime to be collapsed, and a puppet government installed by a major player, and now we're back at square one, which is everybody fighting everybody to see whose puppet gets in there. And even if somebody wins cleanly, in 20-some years we'll see another Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, when the government that's installed is no longer aligned with the interests of the superpower.

As an American soldier serving in South Korea, I work alongside Korean soldiers (KATUSAs).  They also regard North Korea as something of a throwback to older times, not a real threat at all.  The Koreans I met don't seem to want to reconnect with NK at all.  They seem to see the people of NK as too backwards to integrate into their society and don't want the social burden of millions of starving uneducated backward people ruining their country.  Sounds harsh, but thats seems to be the 'common man' opinion with all the Korean soldiers I know.  (also, despite being the closest military forces to the DMZ, they are supremely confident in crushing the NK military should war break out.)

Because most people can't do anything to change the situation in NK, so they resort to jokes instead. Not everyone has the time to worry about something on a macro level like this. I have learned a long time ago that circlejerking about "TIANANMEN 1989 NEVER FORGET" won't magically clear smogs, eliminate corruption, or relieve any burdens from the shoulders of young Chinese students. This also applies to the Korean peninsula.

I honestly think the most likely answer is that she found a way to climb in by herself, thinking that she was protecting herself. I know that it keeps being said that it would have been very hard/impossible for her to do that, but there's a lot of liability on the university and the maker of the tank to insist that people can't just randomly climb into them. 

EDIT: When my son is psychotic, he does *extremely* dangerous things, thinking that he is keeping himself safe from either people that no one else can see or numbers or demons or whatever. I've found him in the basement, he used to wander the neighborhood until we installed double deadbolts, I've had to stop him from bolting into traffic. The point being that he has more fear of these things that don't exist than he does of the real dangers of drowning, traffic, getting lost, whatever. Most people are like that when they are psychotic. Not all, but most.

I don't know if it's just an old elevator, but she stands still for a good 20 seconds without crossing the threshhold, and the hold door button usually only lasts for like 5 seconds.

Also, her waving her arms isn't the weird movement. That starts at about 1:57, where her arms and wrists begin twisting and writhing in weird gestures, and she's completely outside the threshhold, so it doesn't look like she's testing for a motion sensor.

Her killer works for the hotel, tells her there's a cool secret room hes taking her to. She goes into the elevator thinking its the room. He knows about the cameras inside so just stands outside pushing the button over and over so she cant leave and the door stays open. Finally he's able to draw her away and she follows him to the water tower.

The goal of communism was never totalitarianism though. So who knows how it would have actually evolved if the whole world ran with it, and if separate movements implemented different versions of it. After all, most of the so called "founders" of communism claimed that it could only ever succeed, if the whole developed world followed it. 

As much as I admire your alternative history predictions, I feel like it is far too hard to accurately do.

>The result is an alternate history where all of continental Europe is under the Iron Curtain.

This is just flat-out wrong. The Iron Curtain was put up because the Communist parties of Eastern Europe were imposed by and modeled after the USSR. Even when the Communists [attempted to take over Germany in 1919](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution), they attempted to implement [a different form of Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourgism) than the Marxist-Leninism of the USSR.

Furthermore, in the one country of Europe where Communism wasn't imposed but arose independently, in Yugoslavia, It was a much more [liberal and market-friendly form of Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titoism) and actually led to conflict between [Tito and Stalin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_split). Communists weren't some sort of hivemind that believed in totalitarianism for the sake of totalitarianism, they had tons of disagreements and many of them were killed by other Communists for it. 

>the UK also suffers economically and undergoes a communist revolution. Since the entire developed world has gone Communist, support for Communism builds in the US, and the result is a reactionary police-state. The entire world becomes totalitarian.

I don't know why you would assume this, [Oswald Mosely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosely) and the Fascists were pretty powerful in Britain, as were [Fascist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falange) [movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrofascism) [in the](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_of_August_Regime) [rest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e) [of Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetniks). Although I think it is likely that the non-Communist regimes would become more reactionary (they were already pretty hostile to the movement, and [had been since the Russian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War) and Civil War), there's no way of knowing if they would go towards Communism or Fascism, or even remain Liberal democracies. 

>It's entirely possible without Hitler, Nazi Germany doesn't open hostilities with the USSR, and the continues on for decades.

Not really, the ["Drive towards the East"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drang_nach_Osten) had been part of German nationalist ideology since the 19th Century. Hitler wasn't the first who looked East for Lebensraum, just the most ambitious. There's no reason to believe the Nazi party would just drop [one it's key platform points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum) just because Hitler is dead. Whoever the new leader is, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Bormann, Hess or whoever, they would all want to expand Germany's borders East. Not to mention "Judeo-Bolshevism" was the big enemy, the party had been campaigning for years on the need to fight the Soviet regime, they weren't about to stop that anytime soon. 

>Neo-Nazis can go around saying things about how the Nazis went astray, and how Hitler wouldn't have let the Holocaust happen, etc.

Neo-Nazis already do say this. Except they say it about people like [Rohm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm) or the [Strasser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Strasser) [Brothers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Strasser).

Well, im too late to this discussion but i like to contribute as well. Like you i have made this travel. You theroy is interessting but wrong at a crucial point. Facism wasnt a bigger thing in prenazi germany than it is now. Only Hitler/the NSDAP made is so popular. The facsim movement was very weak and small and only ganined influence because of the charismatic and brillant rethorical speaker Hitler was.

Here is what what happened if you would kill Hitler early enough:

Lets assume you have one chance to go back in time and you choose to bomb Hitler at the Hofbräuhaus at the 24. February 1920 where he would held his first important speech infront of 2000 people. You choose this point in time because Hitler hasnt done anything yet but you still want to blow up as many early nazis as possible. So you blow him up.

 Bang.

Great. Is it? Well... This doesnt change much for europe. You killed a guy and some of his racist party friends. But the social unrests in germany proceed to result. Another person, wich equal rhetorical skills and charisma will apear. We will call him Argos, just for the fun of it. He gets elected the same way Hitler got elected but he will do this on a different political platform. But WW2 will still happen but the holocaust does not.

Argos is the contrary to Hitler. He is not insane.(Well he is, but in a much more dangerous and controlled way.) Hes not megalomaniac and he is a brillant strategist who will listen to his Generals. (Which are still the same Hitler got.) The German forces are now much stronger because of this. Argos could form a mighty german army where religons doesnt matter. He forms his army after napoleonic morals which makes his army superior to any army in the world, by moral, education and technical advantages. Still he kills all and everything that thinks otherwise to his party believes. There is only one Argos.

Argos expands into poland and fortifies his position instead of continuing to expand into the East. Same as Hitler, Argos takes in a Blitzkrieg fashion the Benelux, France and kills all the British Soldiers at Dunkirk, leaving Britain shattered. But then he stops. He plays the political game and stabilises the geopolitical situation for now. Now, not only are the german forces much much stronger, but most of the german intellectual elite has never left the country. In fact noone defected because Argos gives them all the Resources they need and scientists do what they do best under such conditions. They invent and build. Van Brown works in Pennemünde, without all the hassle the nazis gave him, on long distance rockets. Einstein, while not a fan of Argos and outspoken against the war, never had a reason to flee the country. He keeps working in Berlin.

The german counterpart of the "Manhatten Project", the German nuclear energy project, short the Uranium Club, is Argos pet project. The Uranium Club is therefore much faster in their research, because all the physicists, engineers, and mathematicians who were driven out of Germany by Hitler as early as 1933 are still there and working as hard as they can for Argos. Also the USA doesnt have much time to look closely at Europe because they are focused on the Japanese Movement and the developments in the Pacific Area. Germany develops the atom bomb.

A german nuke carried by the japanese fleet hits Peral Harbor in a preemptive strike. Argos forces the surrender of all major nations on the continent after decimating every other capitol city with nuclear weapons. Europe becomes a single nation headed by a dictator. Building an entire eastern Powerbloc and threatening the rest of the world. The US is forced to expand into canada, mexico and south america to fortify all possible points of entry for nuclear weapon drops. Both continents enter into a war that nobody is sure who will win.

or we could have not given the scapegoat germans, who were sort of forced into a war they had no chance of winning, to pay war reparations, and instead done what we did after WW2 and helped rebuild them. hitler wouldn't be so bitter for a start, not to mention would not have been even close to as popular. Germany would have no longer been a powder keg, and all of Europe would be allies with the US and the red threat would have been quickly shut down. 

that's my least worst timeline example, there's an infinite number of them though.

I suppose possible, but unlikely. Fascism was in many ways a defense mechanism against the spread of Communism. I can't imagine they would have co-existed peacefully much longer than they already had.

Also, what would happen if you killed Hitler (and possibly other Nazi leaders such as Goebbels) at some point early in the war? Still late enough that the Holocaust was underway and had even more witnesses than the alpha timeline (i.e. Nazism is discredited), but severely reducing the scope of the slaughter. Seems like something to try.

They would probably have gone through with operation Sealion as well which means no D-Day or western front. Britain falls and the Americans sue for peace and would probably support the nazis against communism. 

And no holocaust means no need for those scientists to leave. So now you have the manhattan project (although they'd probably call it something different) and all that rocket science in Germany instead. 

You could go on and on from there.

So the entire world becoming communist is ...a bad thing? Do you even know why exactly all those backwards countries that thought they could jump over to *communizam* turned into dictatorships? Oh, I forgot! Communism means totalitarian murderous dictatorship a priori! Take my gold! Praise teh capitalism!

Also, fascism was the answer of capital against rising class consciousness in the proletariat. My guess is that without Hitler it would have been equally terrible. History is not made by men, but by the material conditions that underly... yada yada, you know this part.

If Hitler was killed,  there still where many other fascist groups, at least early on, before he really gained power. If he was killed early on in the war, before relations with Russia turned sour, fascist Germany may have had a victory over a great deal of western Europe. Fascism becomes a viable political option,  and perhaps popular with a number of European countries. 

Fascism was very popular among intellectuals in the interwar period.  With major publications on fascism.  In France, Denmark, etc... there was a growing interest in it as a political theory. 
World War Two doesn't happen,  the depression lasts longer,  [fascism starts looking pretty good to lots of people]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqpZ7ZqJ3Pg&feature=youtube_gdata_player).

actually, if there was no WW2 then the British Empire and Commonwealth (which by now would probably have morphed into the Commonwealth of Nations as colonies developed and became stable countries of their own) would probably be the worlds superpower.

Think about it, the combined resources and manpower of India, Half of Africa, Most of Oceania, Canada and the UK (plus all the other important bits of the former Empire), economically successfull due to trade between them, even more so with trade with other powers.

Downside: Everyone else is living in a totalitarian hell hole (except the USA and parts of Latin America).

For some reason this has given me the impression that Hitler himself didn't want to do any of the evil attributed to him but he was the 'chosen one' to save the 20th Century from further evil and descending into pure ideological chaos. That would be a movie to divide opinion.

What do you mean you killed Hitler at different points in time? 

I doubt you have a working time machine, and you can't kill someone multiple times in this situation unless you stopped yourself from killing him the first time. That would create a paradox.

Also, I don't know of any video games where they explain the end result of you killing Hitler at a different point in time than in reality when he shot himself.

Lastly, alternate history timelines are too unpredictable and unlikely. Don't even think about falling back on those for an argument.

So, what do you mean you've killed him multiple times?

Then there was a guy who, for weeks, planned a bombing and strapped the bombs to multiple pillars in the building where Hitler would hold his speech, set them on a timer, and ran away as far as he could.

All great points. He also had pretty stupid ideas when it came to funding research projects - he was obsessed with certain projects like the V2 (resources and labour could better be used elsewhere), he threatened to defund the Me-262 unless it was a bomber (he eventually caved to let it be an interceptor, but too little too late), infighting and an order by him led to the StG-44 being developed secretly, his focus on too many fronts and so many more things.

 He didn't drag them out of depression by murdering a group of people... 

The hatred of certain untermensch was part of a project to establish a continuity to the German nation, and an unchallenged assumption that they deserved their position as a superior race of Europeans. If anything the subordination of none ayrians was just a way to legitimise and naturalise the Nazi belief of their genetic superiority. However, that's by no means the only thing he did while in power, and initially didn't necessarily imply genocide needed to occur. Admittedly it did result in a disgustingly racist society that feared anyone who didn't conform to ayrian ideals, but was it so different to the hatred and fear of the red under the bed under McCarthy in the early years? 

Hitler did a hell of a lot of good stuff for Germany. In terms of judging him through a Machiavellian lense he was really quite successful. 

Please don't get me wrong, I am in no way condoning Hitler's actions, but to say he achieved everything he did 'through murdering a whole group of people' is spurious and belittles some of the very real achievements he had with regards to his economic and nation building policies. That said, it doesn't stop him being (in the words of eddy Izard) a 'mass murdering fuckhead'.

I certainly didn't down vote you, but the 3rd point is indisputable: The RAF was on its last legs when Hitler ordered London destroyed instead. The RAF was able to recover, and Hitler ' s chance to invade Britain was forever lost. (It was well-understood that an amphibious invasion could not succeed against a country with a functioning air force).

They were not. One was being guarded by a bouncer who was not letting anyone ( except the band and affiliates) through, and the rest were located at the end of turns in the hallway in the adjoining room that most people didn't know were there because they couldn't see them.

I personally like the *MURICA* version better:

> A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist

>”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

>At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

>”How old is this rock, pinhead?”

>The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”

>”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”

>The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

>The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

>The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

Michael Dukakis tried to eliminate the myth that he was a pansy, weak, left-wing dove. So, he tried to copy Margaret Thatcher's tank stunt, but it backfired horribly, and the GOP used the silly image of Dukakis in the tank to make fun of him. It's considered to be the biggest political gaffe ever.

Cracked article was half wrong half hand-waving. Believe it if you want but investigate on your own. Short summary of what you get wrong: everything. There were no naked bodies, only partially undressed bodies, there's no mystery there: the survivors undressed them to get clothes. Scattered bodies have nothing to do with an avalanche: they tell a story of how the group moved and they were quite active all of them. Most of them died of hypothermia or from numb crushing blows received long after they left the camp. There were no signs of an avalanche although it is mentioned in the case files as a theory. The radiation test was requested, administered, and confirmed radiation.  

[Here are the case docs](https://sites.google.com/site/hibinaud/home/zaklucenie-eksperta), check it with google translate or something.

Can scale ravines and then dig down into 4 meters of snow and hide all trace? I mean I will admit that I only read the wikipedia article and would not be surprised at all if stuff like "evidence of decay brought about by maggots as well as tracks of coyotes and bird droppings all suggest that the missing eye and tongue were the result of scavengers" were intentionally (or unintentionally) excluded in order to keep the air of mystery about the story--everyone loves a good mystery. But at the same time, I would imagine there would still be maggots present if the missing organs were consumed by them and why would other scavengers such as carrion and coyotes only eat the tongue and eyes when they are big and presumably hungry enough to dig through more than 12 feet of snow for a meal? Maybe that part was simply unclearly written in the article, and there had in fact been snow fall between death and corpse discovery but even still I don't imagine in the winter with heavy snow fall that most scavengers would leave what is essentially a sack of food mostly untouched and instead enjoy the gourmet of the eyes and tongue of only one of the corpses and then move on to find more food.

Yeah, and takes everything with it.  Tents would not be perfectly intact with just a few rips after an avalanche.  They would be completely torn apart.

I'm still skeptical to be honest, there just isn't enough to back up that theory. I don't have a better theory though, there are some things that don't add up. The people investigating the scene would have most likely been able to identify the scene of an avalanche. From looking at some of the pictures the camp doesn't appear to be covered in a thick layer of snow which they would have to trudge through after an avalanche destroyed their tent. And the idea that hypothermia caused delusions before the experienced hikers could gather their wits and return to the tent for the rest of supplies is just kinda seals the deal for me. I don't argue that they could have *thought* there was an avalanche and in their panic abandoned camp, but still not explanation as why they did not return. I'm no expert on the subject, I've just read a bunch and looked at pictures.

This was taken a month after the incident. The tent was still standing, stuff inside it was intact. People who left it were mostly uninjured, except for one guy who had skull trauma. If that was an avalanche, you'd expect there to be more damage to everything, won't you?

Fair enough, that's a plausible explanation, sorry for overseeing this. Still hard to believe they just bailed because of that. I think they maybe got really, really, drunk and decided to go on a boat trip for fun or some other reason, then the boat capsized, the end.

You wrote off an entire indigenous people as cannibals, that's offensive, I'm not even Maori, but I find the fact that your summation of an entire people as 'NZ cannibals' is somewhat offensive, when only a small percentage of Maori tribes were cannibalistic, and even then no more than any other pacific group of people.

No, the current population of the Republic is 4.6. The population of the island is 6 (actually about 6.3). That's not a political statement, but a comparison with the all-Ireland figures of the 1840's.

*First paragraph [from wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatoan_Island):*

---

**Hatteras Island** (historically, **Croatoan Island**) is a barrier island located off the North Carolina coast. Dividing the Atlantic Ocean and the Pamlico Sound, it runs parallel to the coast, forming a bend at Cape Hatteras. It is part of North Carolina's Outer Banks and includes the towns of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras. It contains the largest part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. It is almost entirely in Dare County, North Carolina, but there is a very small sliver of about 45 acres (180,000 m2) which extends southwest into Hyde County.

I heard a very interesting podcast about him. English is not my native language so I'm sorry if what I say is unclear and maybe even incorrect. 
But from what I understood, his beliefs were that technology is and will be the downfall of man. He wants to restart the global society by killing off billions of people over a long time-span and also neutralize big parts (if not all) of the industrialization.

Please, correct me if I'm wrong :)

Not op but im sure he's referring to his view on technology...was unique for his time and considering the recent events of NSA and the ongoing net neutrality fight it's quite accurate:

"It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and freedom, because technology is by far the more powerful social force and continually encroaches on freedom through REPEATED compromises."

Essentially he said that men are better suited to be happy without technology and industrialization, at least in the medium term, because our minds are conditioned to want to labour, but it takes no work to live. Even the simplest skill like pouring coffee can afford enough money to get food, sex, and shelter. But this leaves people unhappy. In his view, a person would be happier if he went out on his own, built his own cabin and trapped his own meat because the day to day wins are better for his psychology.

The reason he hates leftists is that he views them as the inadvertent synthesizers of the system. By calling for things like womens rights, and affirmative action they push people like minorities into the system. He also thinks that they are losers.

That is your too long didn't read, to understand more of the reasons *why* he believes these things you kinda have to read the whole thing.

>[T]he system cannot be reformed in such a way as to reconcile
freedom with technology. The only way out is to dispense
with the industrial technological system altogether. This
implies revolution, not necessarily an armed uprising, but
certainly a radical and fundamental change in the nature
of society.

That's his main thesis. If you want to know his arguments you need to read the whole thing.

The USSR was a non-factor in the detonation.  It was to get the Japanese to surrender unconditionally, (which they didn't, they pretty much got their terms even after we nuked them).  The USSR didn't get the Atomic Bomb until over [4 years later](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/soviets-explode-atomic-bomb).  Yeah, the propaganda states that we wanted "unconditional Surrender".  What the propaganda films don't tell you, is that [Emporer HiroHito died January 7, 1989, from natural causes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirohito).  He died as the ruling Emperor of Japan.  We nuked them just because we could, it did not change WWII.

The Trinity Detonation was a Plutonium bomb.  Hiroshima was the first detonation in the history of Mankind where a Uranium bomb was detonated.  Not just in war; EVER.

*First para from article about [Trinity (nuclear test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test):*

---

**Trinity** was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear device. This test was conducted by the United States Army on July 16, 1945, in the Jornada del Muerto desert about 35 miles (56km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, at the new White Sands Proving Ground, which incorporated the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range. (The site is now the White Sands Missile Range.) The date of the test is usually considered to be the beginning of the Atomic Age.

As I've stated several times, the Trinity detonation was a plutonium bomb, while the Hiroshima detonation was  uranium bomb.

Honestly, I have no idea what the "best" option was. But then, neither does anyone else have much of an idea beyond speculation. Some speculation is more educated than others, but in the end...we're all speculating based on the information we were given by a government with a vested interest in the public supporting the actions they took. That information may or may not represent the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Now, I'm not going to go all tin-foil-hat on anyone...but let me tell you this much: Even if it IS the entire truth, the reasons being given are pretty weak when it comes to justifying the murder of tens of thousands of civilians. 

For THAT to be the best option, I would expect us to have tried a few other ones first. 

Let me ask you this: What if we didn't have "the bomb"? What would have been the best option? Would the "best option" have been for us to bomb schools, hospitals, offices, grocery stores...basically just drop all the metal and high explosive we can find on those two cities? Or would we have tried something else?

And if we wouldn't have been willing walk up and down the streets of Hiroshima individually cutting the throat every Japanese man, woman and child we could find until they surrendered, why is this any better?

Aug 8, 1945: Soviets declare war on Japan; invade Manchuria


One million Soviet men were sent to invade Manchuria, against a 700,000 strong Jap army.  Only 650 men were killed on the Jap side during that engagement.  Three days later, nagasaki was obliterated. Japan surrendered 02 September 1945.  The casualties taken by the Soviet Union were minimal.

Of course it's still independence day. I'm not up in arms saying we should change the national holiday. But freedom of the colonies was declared by Congress on July 2nd, the declaration was adopted on July 4th, and it wasn't signed by pretty much all of Congress  until early August. A lot of people picture July 4th as the day where everyone lined up and bravely signed their name. But it was way more spread out than that so yes, the situation does lose some of its magic.   

Edit: And op said this was the 50th anniversary of the signing, which is pretty much entirely untrue. I was just pointing that out. The rest is just semantics.

[Actual facts](http://www.history.com/news/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-declaration-of-independence) are fairly important. Most delegates signed on August 2nd, but it was adopted by Congress officially on July 4th, giving us our 'Independence Day' date.

3 Chinese citizens were killed. The Chinese govt maintains they were reporters and at the time the US said it was an accident. Triangulated coordinates of tactical information relayed via private channel broadcast indicated the embassy as the prime location of origination.

It was completely accidental.  The CIA hadn't updated their maps when the Chinese moved their embassy into the building and they provided the target data.  The building originally had a logistics function for the defense ministry.  I would know, my father was SACEUR at the time.

From Wikipedia 

>On February 26, the searchers found the abandoned and badly damaged tent on Kholat Syakhl. Mikhail Sharavin, the student who found the tent, said "the tent was half torn down and covered with snow. It was empty, and all the group's belongings and shoes had been left behind. "[2] Investigators said the tent had been cut open from inside. A chain of eight or nine sets of footprints, left by several people who were wearing only socks, a single shoe or were barefoot, could be followed and led down toward the edge of nearby woods (on the opposite side of the pass, 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) north-east), but after 500 metres (1,600 ft) they were covered with snow. At the forest edge, under a large cedar, the searchers found the remains of a fire, along with the first two bodies, those of Yuri Krivonischenko and Yuri Doroshenko, shoeless and dressed only in their underwear. The branches on the tree were broken up to five meters high, suggesting that a skier had climbed up to look for something, perhaps the camp. Between the cedar and the camp the searchers found three more corpses, Dyatlov, Zina Kolmogorova and Rustem Slobodin, who seemed to have died in poses suggesting that they were attempting to return to the tent.[2] They were found separately at distances of 300, 480 and 630 meters from the tree.

Yes the "prestige" effect.  Once you know the answer to the trick, the trick is no longer exciting.

And yes it's been debunked.  All of it has been easily explained in what basically amounts as what you described.  And the woman with the missing eye and tongue is due to scavenger animals eating them (which is what they tend to go for first, the soft tissues)

It's not on here (and I don't think it would count as significant) but the Girl Scout Murders creep me out pretty hard. I'm on my phone so I can't link it, but three girls were raped and murdered on their first night of GS camp. I went to Girl Scout camp so it's really creepy for me to consider how easy it would really be to creep up on a campsite like that. There was a huge manhunt and a suspect was taken into custody but it ended up a huge political mess and he was never proven to really be the murderer. He went to jail for other crimes and died soon after.

All that happened in the 1970s but there are still a lot of people who discuss the case and hope to find a conclusion... They have a web forum. All in all it's extremely creepy and disturbing.

Stalin and Mao killed their own people, that doesn't make it better - it's actually worse in my opinion, but that's a big difference from an outsiders perspective. And countries with internal genocides, pogroms and civil war in their past would rather not talk about it.

I don't think the fact that the Holocaust was focused on the elimination of the Jewish people has much to do with anything in terms of its infamy

Psychology is the general study of human behavior and related sciences (psychoneurology, psychiatry). It's a more general term.

Psychiatry is specifically about using artificial chemicals to change brain chemistry, thereby changing behavior (i.e., psychoreactive drugs like Prozac).

Sorry you're getting downvoted, because you are correct. It shouldn't even be called a "science", because to me, that implies utilizing the scientific method rather than just throwing drugs around at the whim of major pharmaceutical corporations, or throwing diagnoses around in accordance with the whims of their personal beliefs or current societal mores. 

I think most people who are so sure that psychology is a "science" probably don't realize how often diagnoses have been quietly removed from the DSM. Like homosexuality, for example.

Well not to piss on your parade, but Sauron did a lot of evil shit in the first age after joining Melkor. Then there was a bunch of evil shit with Morgoth, then Melkor fell, and Sauron ran off to try to get him back. In Númenor Sauron also did some kinda evil shit, but not really that evil compared to the rest of the shit he'd pulled. And in middle earth he made the rings to hoodwink everyone in middle earth.

I agree with you that it was disgusting, at least by our standards of mental healthcare today. It does seem that the damage done wasn't intended to be so bad. Lobotomies were fairly common then, and some of them did "work out."

I don't agree that it was done maliciously, or that it was done because she "knew too much" as some people in this thread are implying.

It was a pretty poor decision to make, but on some level they probably did think it would help her.

There were hours, we skipped around a bit, not very well lit and INCREDIBLY eerie. Knowing what ultimately has to happen might amplify that. This was years ago, and the largest impression on me was watching this guy who was alive and talking getting slowly less life-like from being inebriated and losing blood, some grunting through pain and then when he's finally killed in the tub. After that, his body is treated like a slab of meat. Miewes was disgustingly proud of everything he was doing.

sorry for the delay, my laptop died and I just go a new one.  I wouldn't call it a biography. It's more of a true story about how this guy lived and committed so many murders.  And he happened to do this in Chicago against the backdrop of the 1893 World Fair. So half the book is dedicated to how the city planned and pulled that off, which actually ends up being even more interesting than the murder/crime part of the book.

It is def Larson's best work and I've read several of his books.

Just to play devils advocate here... I could be wrong feel free to correct me. But regardless of profit or social gain if you are consistently killing people are you not a serial killer? I mean it's hard to say she didn't get visceral pleasure or psychological urges to do this, it obviously happened more then  once. Or does that make you not a serial killer but something else if you do it for profit? What about if you employ an army to do it, or a bomb, would politicians that give orders to kill be considered serial killers if it happens over a period of time with gaps in between?.....

---

A **weasel word** (also, **anonymous authority**) is an informal term for equivocating words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that something specific and meaningful has been said, when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim, or even a refutation has been communicated.

Ok lets just look at the facts shall we Holmes was born in 1861 he is thought to have started killing in 1888 but he might have started a year or two earlier who knows

Micajah "Big" Harpe was born around 1768 his brother Wiley "Little" Harpe was born around 1770 that would so they are older then Holmes by about 90 years. in 1797 they go around raping and killing with a group of Cherokee Indians. they then spend the rest of there lives killing people and running farther west it is thought that they may have killed 40+ people between them. but some parts of there story are unreliable but they are thought to be America's first serial killers.

Delphine LaLaurie was born in 1775 in 1834 her house was burned and it was reviled that she had several slaves chained up and that they had been tortured over a long period of time.

The Bloody Benders were a family that owned a small inn. in 1873 11 bodies were found on there property with there skulls bashed in although there could have been more. They were without a doubt serial killers.

The Servant Girl Annihilator was an unknown serial killer that killed 16 girls in Austin Texas in 1884, 4 years before Holmes started. 

And Finally Joseph Briggen started feeding his farmhands to his pigs in 1880, 8 years before Holmes but he was not found out until 1902 he killed 12+ people.

so in short your documentaries either got the facts wrong or lied to spice up the story.

*First para from linked Wikipedia article [Dunbar's number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number):*

---

**Dunbar's number** is suggested to be a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable, cohesive group. No precise value has been proposed for Dunbar's number. It has been proposed to lie between 100 and 230, with a commonly used value of 150. Dunbar's number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship, nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number which might be much higher and likely depends on long-term memory size.

I guess I just don't see anything noble about his experiments or his motives.  What difference does it make if he was a racist and/or a sadist?  I was mostly referring to your considering him "not really a Nazi" because he did medical experiments instead of just gassing them.  If you read about his time at Auschwitz, he's one of the worst, most cruel Nazis (and that says a lot).  He has more actual blood on his hands than any of the higher echelon and he knew every one of his subjects personally.  And honestly, a lot of his experiments were just stupid, especially the twin stuff.

We demonize them *because they murdered ten million people*. The Allies may not have been perfectly noble and just crusaders, but nothing they did is even remotely comparable to the Holocaust. The only danger is in making them inhuman monsters and forgetting that humanity is capable of such evil... And the comment you replied to was very specifically against that risk.

> So what you're saying is 'all you have to do is be ordered to experiment on humans by a megalomaniac dictator running a world power who tries and fails to take over the world, and you can get away with it!'

I'm not sure how you inferred that from what I said. Besides, even if they are ordered they could have refused--at least to some degree.

>Somehow I don't feel like there will be a lot of people lining up to take advantage of that precedent.

I don't know why you feel like that. Wouldn't scientists working for dictatorial regimes be less fearful of conducting unethical experiments because if they do well they would be spared?

>And you utterly fail to acknowledge the other side of the coin: here we have data that in some cases could end up saving tens of thousands of lives over the next fifty years (before medical science becomes good enough to figure it out sans-vivisection. Remember, this isn't all about nerve gas etc, there is a remarkable amount of useful data.) Now that this data exists, you are arguing that the chance that some other group might believe that their similar activities — but not ones ordered by a sovereign power run by a criminal madman, because let's face it, if you torture enough doctors you can find some who will experiment for you anyway — won't be punished, is large enough, and the potential result awful enough, to condemn both the scientists and those tens of thousands of people to die, the latter simply so justice can be served on the former.
This is what you call 'looking at it from an ethical standpoint', is it?

I think your stance on ethics is too utilitarian. By pardoning some of the most heinous acts performed by man, aren't you greatly undermining all your principles of justice and of law? I think you would also sanction killing a billionaire, because the suffering caused to him and his family is hugely outweighed by the millions of disadvantaged people that money would help. Was I wrong to extrapolate this?

Pfah. You and your theories and you hypo-theeses. We know what punishment is for in the US, and it's 90% 'revenge' and 10% 'keep the scary brown people away from me daddy!'

And we hope maybe the revenge might prove a deterrent, but we don't really care about that *at all* (or we would actually use our knowledge of what makes an effective deterrent.) And we can no longer even *pretend* to care about rehabilitation: in any jurisdiction where the public has the slightest bit of say in crime and punishment, when given a choice between two alternatives, they invariably demand the one that will make rehabilitation more difficult, even in the few cases where the options are clearly explained and the issue is not demagogued by some right-wing asshole.

I finally unfriended someone on Facebook when he said he was part of the 'objectively pro-assrape' contingent, but not before he had dozens of likes. This is what the US public thinks prison is for.

Regardless of whether the information gained was useful or not, the research was conducted unethically, and was universally horrific.  Realistically these scientists tortured people and took notes.

Pacific theatre: Japanese treated prisoners as slave labor, wholesale slaughtered them near the end of the war with nary a thought, even from the beginning viewed (specifically white prisoners) as non-human enemies, inherently xenophobic racial bias strongly evident

Eastern Front: the most POWs of any war died on this front (statistically, more than every POW death in all other wars combined [technicalities could be raised to argue this down, but it's essentially true]), well over 1 million Slavs and Russians were frozen/starved/shot/tortured/beaten to death intentionally, on orders from Hitler; even before the order from Hitler, Slavs and Communists were still killed in high numbers; blatant political reasoning, inherent racial bias can be argued based off Mein Kampf readings

Western Front: less than 5% of all POWs on this front ended up dead; few, if any, of this % are believed to be as a result of mistreatment. Geneva Convention upheld to the fullest extent possible in almost all recorded scenarios, leading to the conclusion that white on white captivity (using white loosely, as is colloquially used in the 21st century) was the only captivity in which prisoners were treated well. Incidentally, this is also a "control group" of sorts, since it's the only theatre of war where Geneva Convention guidelines were completely upheld.

>Not saying that there isn't plenty of evidence that runs contrary to the theory, but it isn't a hypothesis.

I don't understand your point. A theory just means there is a certain amount of compelling evidence to support the hypothesis. That doesn't mean the theory is true. If there is contradicting evidence, then that theory is subject to criticism which is what I was partaking in.

>It just happens to be that this event occurs at about exactly the same time.

You should do some research into the human population bottle-necking. The Wikipedia article is a good start. There is no solid consensus on the time range of the bottle neck, with some earlier estimates figuring the event to have occurred 70,000 years ago, and recent ones [saying it happened 2 million years ago, and that more recent supposed events of human bottle-necking don't follow the evidence.](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/1/2.full) This is an extremely complicated issue, after all.

>If you're going to pick a less reputable publication than wikipedia, huffingtonpost is probably a good one.

This is fallacious. It doesn't matter if the article was posted at Wikipedia or Huffington post, what matter are the citations the article is using. The Huffington Post article is a reporting of the [same article at livescience.](http://www.livescience.com/29130-toba-supervolcano-effects.html) Furthermore, this isn't Huffington Post's analysis, and they never claim responsibility for the research. It is also a sourced article.

>"We have been able to show that the largest volcanic eruption of the last two million years did not significantly alter the climate of East Africa," said researcher Christine Lane, a geologist at the University of Oxford. 

Just because Huffington Post publishes or republishes something does not make it wrong.

*Archaeologists who in 2013 found a microscopic layer of glassy volcanic ash in sediments of Lake Malawi, and definitively linked the ash to the 75,000-year-old Toba super-eruption, went on to note a complete absence of finding the change in fossil type close to the ash layer that would be expected following a severe volcanic winter. This result led the archaeologists to conclude that the largest known volcanic eruption in the history of the human species did not significantly alter the climate of East Africa.*

While such an eruption would be heavily catastrophic, I don't think it is remotely an existential threat to the human species anymore.

Just so you know, I went to the Russian Museum of Erotica just to see Rasputin's penis. The Erotica Museum is pretty much just a hodge-podge collection of antique Spenser Gift's type trinkets. THE IMPORTANT PART IS that it's also an operating VD clinic. With real patients and doctors and nurses performing STD checks. I had no idea, and thought it was just a museum, so I walked into one of the closed doors and got a full look on some guy getting his bangers and mash inspected by a doctor. I got kicked out of the museum.

There is no need to be snarky. Historians do tend to read multiple sources, especially when there is conflicting evidence. The brazen bull, for example, was not commonly used and is now subject to myth and sensationalism. I'm not even sure there is an authentic surviving brazen bull from the related era to make judgement on the design.


By the way, I am OP. A list on a random website is not an accredited source, which is why I was open to discussion on the steam vs scream debate.

He wasn't even the guy who made the claim.

But he is, kind of, right. A lot of the stuff we see is all theater. And likely, a lot of the "torture devices" you'd see when drug into the torture chamber were for psychological effect. 

Oh, an iron maiden looks scary. But a sharp knife and a iron gut is far more effective than any overly complex machine. 

Granted, that assumes torture is effective (it really isn't).

Radioactive contamination of water is significantly less dangerous than radioactive contamination above the surface. Ingested particles could build up over time, but it would be very unlikely for this to cause significant harm to anything but a few organisms.

I think I remember a wikileaks leak detailing that China was getting sick of NK causing such a fuss that they would be okay with NK uniting with SK and SK's competent government taking over. Which I could see happening because then it would probably be easier to transport goods from China to Korea and vice versa. I could be wrong though, strategically the NK is a good buffer zone.

Keep in mind as well how much time, money and resources it would take for SK to reincorporate the North. You have millions of starving, and brainwashed citizens who are living in a largely agrarian society devoid of most modern amenities. South Korea would literally be bankrupt from the amount of money it would take to revitalize the north. To be perfectly honest South Korea has no interest in uniting the two, as the North would be such a drain on their economy and resources it's not even worth it at this point.

KATUSA "suck honey" on government dime, in the Korean parlance. They're mostly over privileged brats who get it easy through their parents' connections. One shouldn't take their snobbish opinions as representative of the Korean whole. And their baseless hubris regarding any military confrontation (I'm sure you've seen these kids "train") is precisely why Korea would be fucked without US support.

I just did some digging through the blog and I think Euron_Greyjoy is right in the queue theory. The most recent post from December was reblogged from someone who posted it 11 months ago, before her death. It was probably queued so far into the future because it's a Christmas scene. As for the other random posts, the ones in February were likely queued because she was supposed to be traveling and figured she wouldn't be posting as much. From what I checked, the other couple of posts were also reblogged from people who posted them before her death. As to why those were queued, I don't have an explanation, but they are photos of people/things she had on her blog before... like that blonde model, also named Elisa. Maybe she just didn't want to spam a bunch of pictures at once?

Please, read your own link:

>Sometimes, a person with severe episodes of mania or depression has psychotic symptoms too, such as hallucinations or delusions. The psychotic symptoms tend to reflect the person's extreme mood. For example, psychotic symptoms for a person having a manic episode may include believing he or she is famous, has a lot of money, or has special powers. In the same way, a person having a depressive episode may believe he or she is ruined and penniless, or has committed a crime. As a result, people with bipolar disorder who have psychotic symptoms are sometimes wrongly diagnosed as having schizophrenia, another severe mental illness that is linked with hallucinations and delusions.

BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder, please Google it. 

Most people with BD will never suffer from hallucinations, but some do, as I made clear in my first comment.

First off, sending literature and major speeches already assumes that. Second, we just sent something thousands, millions, billions of lightyears across space, I don't think sending a few prime numbers and equations would add any more credibility to our intelligence.

No, this is not true. Fascism and national socialism are as much collectivist ideologies as international socialism. The two only differ that one puts emphasis on a specific race while the other is race independent. At the end of the day they are two sides of the same coin.

Also, if you look into the history of communism you'll realize that despite all the ideologies and promises on paper it always turns into national socialism. Just look at all communist countries and you'll realize that at one point nationalism became a very important factor.

If Hitler would have won WWII then Germany would have pretty much looked 100% the same as any communist country in the 2nd half of the 20th century, with the abolishing of private property, central planing of the economy and single party dictatorship. 

If you really think about it there isn't much difference between national socialism and international socialism. Hitler and Stalin were just like two mob bosses fighting for territory and not polar opposites in ideology.

No, and I don't disagree with that

The problem here is that you don't understand the *level* of debt that we're discussing. The German economy itself wasn't producing consumer goods, generally, and especially not for export. Most of its industrial capabilities in the 30's were going directly towards rearmament.

First off, unemployment numbers were fudged. The Nazis removed women from unemployment numbers (they were counted under the Weimar Republic). They also removed Jews in 1935 (as they lost citizenship) and if you were unemployed, you either accepted government-paid labor (the vast majority of projects were not useful public works, unlike in the US) or you were sent to a Concentration Camp. They also enacted conscription as part of rearmament, which also reduced the number. So, yes, he reduced unemployment. Not in an economically healthy manner. Germany's military expenditures until 1938 (I don't have data thereafter) were 10% of their GDP, but that's only counting IMMEDIATE military expenditures, not all the other stuff they were doing that had military applications.

Debt-wise, Germany had a debt of 40 billion Reichsmarks in 1939, and their balance of trade was RM (100 million). Their annual income was RM 15 billion, and their deficit was over RM 15 billion (> 30 billion expenditure). IIRC, their GDP in 1939 was roughly RM 180 billion (or 129, having trouble finding sources). 

This differs from Roosevelt in that the New Deal was explicitly building infrastructure -- the US was trading debt for growth. Germany was trading debt for weapons. Germany was *reliant* on taking other countries' hard currency to fuel their growth - the first thing that happened after marching into Bohemia was all currency reserves were taken. Same with Poland, same with France, Netherlands, Belgium, *etc*. In 1939, actually, the German economy was very close to collapse because of the financial strain of rearmament, hence the decision to invade Poland.

> I certainly didn't down vote you, but the 3rd point is indisputable: The RAF was on its last legs when Hitler ordered London destroyed instead. The RAF was able to recover, and Hitler ' s chance to invade Britain was forever lost. (It was well-understood that an amphibious invasion could not succeed against a country with a functioning air force).

It is certainly disputable; I am disputing it. The RAF had airbases that were well outside of the range of the Luftwaffe; while the Luftwaffe could certainly have achieved air superiority in southern England, the RAF would simply use airbases further north, which *still* had enough range to reach the channel. At that point, it becomes a battle of attrition; a battle Britain is likely to win.

There was no way at *all* that Sealion would have succeeded. *Period*.

1. The Germans had no way to defeat the Royal Navy. Their naval bombing record was extremely poor, and the Royal Navy and the remnants of the RAF would prevent any landing attempt.
2. The Germans lack any proper equipment to mount an invasion with. Their plan was to use river barges... which if they didn't simply sink in the Channel would be extremely vulnerable.
3. The Germans lack the logistical capability to supply/reinforce troops landing in England. Even if they *manage* to land, they will be surrounded and eliminated.
4. The Soviet Union isn't interested in total German victory. Stalin wanted the Germans and the Allies to exhaust one another; a victorious Germany is a *huge* existential threat to the Soviet Union.
5. An invasion of England is something that is likely to trigger American entry into the war before Pearl Harbor. Isolationism only goes so far, and that is likely to worry people enough to intervene.

False on the door thing, you can see in the video they push outward. They simply got stuck as they all tried to push forward and out at once and people in the back were feeling the heat of the fire hence were shoving the hardest which made everyone fall forward in a stacked position.

You could probably tie just about any modern fire safety implementation to a previous fire related-event and say such and such was a result of said incident. The fact remains though that in 2003, sprinklers were not new, building owners and inspectors were not new, the quest for an adequate management staff and operating precedures wasnt new either. So what exactly came from this other than dead bodies? To suggest that the advancement of technology and safety wouldnt have evolved or been possible without this incident, suggests you were born yesterday.

Um Wiki's own motto is "The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit". Universities won't accept stuff from wiki, because it can be changed by so many different people. 

Although many lecturers I know have said Wiki is generally close to accurate, because there is a chance someone can edit something in without inaccuracy, it is not academically suitable. Though I will admit, for obvious stories with LOTS of sources, wiki saves a ton of time.

Ultimately though I know this is reddit, and who cares about being academically suitable. Wide reaching anecdotal stories are ever present, shitty news sources are often cited as "factual", and we basically upvote what we want to be right instead of what is right. Regardless I still think when it comes to a category of story telling that is hard to confirm, wiki should raise red flags even here.

It is correct, it just isn't the most correct.

All venoms are poisons. Thus it is correct to call a snake poisonous, but you cannot call something like a tree frog venomous, unless it has a stinger or fangs, with which to inject the poison.

Let's be real here; when referencing a proper scientific report, media never makes the final cut. It's unreliable, subject to interpretation by people who don't know what they're talking about, and liable to sensationalism. 


The article referenced by wikipedia cites a media report - which in turn cites no reports by independent or even government bodies. Essentially, the radiation claim is bullshit without proper documentation, which is lacking, making an avalanche the most possible scenario.

**Was the type of radiation mentioned in some accounts ever identified? Was it superficial or penetrative? What we mean by this is was it something they touched or did it permeate their bodies? The reason that this is important is that it distinguishes between recent weapon use and merely background exposure.**

Again, the short answer is: The radiation was superficial and this fact has been known for some time.  It is generally irresponsible journalism that has exaggerated the importance of this aspect of the Dyatlov Pass case.

“The radiation referred to has been identified as beta-radiation with the characteristics of isotope K-40.  This is very weak contamination and certainly superficial.”

According to various experts the radiation was minor surface contamination and probably from Lyudmila Dubanina’s coat. It was probably from a laboratory environment (Radium, Radon and Potassium) and not from any recent weapons use.  A point has been made that prior to the moratorium on atomic weapons testing a fair number of detonations had been carried out in Russia and in other parts of the world.  Again, it was not uncommon that small amounts of “fall-out” might be spread far and wide.

Edit: Other sources state that it was a thorium gas mantle in their lamps. In either case, definitely not creepy. Just life.

This is better but still not enough. Short summary of events:

* 9 of them left the tent without being fully dressed and made it ~1km downhill to the safe place. In that time, one of them was apparently lost and eventually died. He was later discovered to have blunt skull trauma at this point.

* The remaining 8 started to collect wood and make fire. Eventually two of them went back to the tent and died from hypothermia on the way, one earlier, another one later.

So far this suggests really bad weather, but skull trauma? Wtf. This calls for actual avalanche, but apparently there was none. Others had no injuries at this point, and the stuff in the tent was later found intact. The photos from eariler in that tent show no signs that any of them had injuries.

* The remaining 6 made fire but it didn't help. Two more of them were found dead at the site of the fire. Corpses were slightly burnt where they were lying close to the fire, which means the fire was still burning after their death.

By this time I'm wondering just what kind of extreme weather it was that 5 top class hikers died in like 45 minutes by simply being outside. They weren't wet, they were mostly dressed - not completely, but they certainly weren't nude.

* The 4 survivors made a snow burrow to hide from the wind. They hid there and still were found dead. They didn't die of hypothermia: instead, all of them died from crushed ribs and skulls, and these injuries supposedly happened after they left the tent (experts said they would not be able to walk for long with them). This probably means their burrow came down on them.

So there's at least four mysteries here, not counting the radiation: 1. Just what kind of weather it was? Weather data from that time did not indicate anything particularly disastrous, 2. What happened that they left the tent? There probably was no avalanche, could have been a fear of avalanche, but why injuries? 3. What happened in the burrow? 4. Why top class hikers failed so utterly in saving their lives?

Sure, all of this can kinda sorta be explained by various bad luck but it's not so simple as cracked paints it to be. It's not just "Avalanche did it".

Skin, too. Basically, her face looked pretty skeletal.

I think the most intriguing thing about the autopsies is that they reveal that every one was banged up. More so than is often implied in reports and articles. In fact, the two men who were found ascending back up to the tent both had injuries on their hands and fingers consistent with punching and hand-to-hand combat.

I've researched it quite a bit and I think it might be possible that there was a drunken brawl over one of the women or something. Then again, a lot of the injuries were described by the doctor as not consistent with an injury that could be delivered by a human being, and how would a simple brawl lead to them all running down the hill? Also, the footprints from the tent down to the hill, were single-file, with the tallest at the back. Implying cooperation and a controlled descent. That's the thing with this case... every theory that begins to seem plausible has some glaring error or flaw.

No, it was: avalanche made them abandon the tent without preparing for the cold first.  Hypothermia caused paradoxal undressing as they ran from the avalanche-stricken tent.  It actually makes a ton of sense when you think about it.

considering they'd all be exposed to the same below zero temperatures and all just have survived an avalanche it's not that hard to conclude they'd all be suffering the same condition.

No it really wouldn't, at least not by requirement.  Considering that at subzero temperatures it wouldn't take much to induce hypothermia and even a small avalanche (one capable of encasing them in snow without  burying them totally) would be enough to crush bone and trap people...which would force them to cut their way out and escape.  Plus being buried in the snow would induce hypothermia quite rapidly, which would explain why they felt "hot" and left without their winter clothes.

Yes I can tell, since you're unfamiliar with [what hypothermia does to you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia#Severe).  They started feeling like they were overheating, fleeing the site of their camp after whatever killed their comrades, and then they underwent either Terminal Burrowing, trying to find cover under ledges and things, or they collapsed in the snow as their limbs gave out due to the cold.  At those temperatures they would have frozen to death in minutes, no time to go back.

What? The tent isn't standing at all, it's practically in tatters. Some of them died from internal injuries, and others from exposure. It doesn't have to be a huge avalanche, just enough to scare them from the tent into the wilderness with no clothes on.

I had to look this up, and this is the quote I found on Wikipedia:

"Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2.[8] The once-held view that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect. The genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can occur."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color

So it sounds like if one of the parents has blue eyes (like, for instance, a European), then the child can also have blue eyes, even if the other parent has brown eyes (a Native American).

He's not really in favor of genocidal activity (although his ideological opponents would, of course, present him that way).  Rather... he's in favor of a voluntary reduction in human population, over time, to reach what he feels are sustainable numbers.  He does want to neutralize/destroy large scale industrialization because he believes that is actually what will lead to genocidal population decline.  And he also believe that the techno-industrial system is largely responsible for the general immiseration of people on the planet today.

Not to mention the drug has been around for thousands of years and has been common knowledge in colombia since before it's existence as a nation. They're not trying to prove it exists; it's to tell people about the drug

Things similar to this have happened where the people ask "for directions" and drug the mark but i am sceptical as to whether or not a mass targetting like this has been done simply due to the fact that it seems like people have a high respect for how dangerous the drug is.

I have heard this my whole life, and everyone seems to ignore it.  The text read: 
>"Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.

Go for it.  Wiki has a decent start, but be aware stuff gets graphic.  Dan Carlin did an episode on it and relationship to A-Bombs (it's long and in "Dan Carlin" style.)  Study how the US switched from targeted to UK style strategic bombing in the first years ('42.)

Given that they had to drop a nuclear bomb and nope the fuck out of there as fast as they could, I don't find it very hard to believe that it really was off target and that they didn't mean to hit the hospital.

After the first bomb was dropped the Japanese war council was given 24 hours and sent a message to surrender or the U.S. would drop another one. They refused when the U.S. dropped the second there was an actual fight among the leaders of Japan because a good sized portion still did not want to surrender. There is a very good BBC documentary with John Hurt that goes into great detail about the entire project including the bomb drop. And even assuming its lying after the first one dropped, why wouldn't they,if they were already going to, surrender?

An invasion would have been longer, costlier, and killed millions. The bombs killed a few hundred thousand in comparison. They were even less horrific than the firebombings that had been going on in many cities in Japan.

I thought it just would have been some burnt buildings at most, also there was just no point in the comment. Nobody said that the nuke was humane, sounds like you got butthurt some dude disagreed and randomly brought up how humane the nuke was and told some story about where it was dropped. What did that have to do with anything? While the nuke wasn't humane it still was probably better than a drawn out invasion.

The USSR was absolutely a factor in the decision. Each ally coveted China as spoils after the war, and we had no interest in splitting up that market. A quick win in Japan, the theory went, would provide a foothold (remember Japan had been occupying chunks of China leading up to, and during the war). Everyone knew victory was assured - the US had been firebombing the shit out of Tokyo and elsewhere -  the only questions were how long and who does the ground work (spoiler, it would have been Soviets by a large margin). So the bomb gave Truman a way to win quickly, save a bunch of American lives, and, above all, win the peace aka the China market. We now know it didn't work out according to plan (which is why we invested so much into Japan's reconstruction - to manufacture a strong regional trading partner in lieu of China).TL;DR The USSR was not only a factor, but possibly *the leading* factor in deciding to drop the bombs.

Japan didn't care about the nukes. What's another city destroyed overnight? Almost all of their cities, save for a few in the north, had been leveled by our conventional strikes. If none of their other cities prompted a surrender, why would these two all of a sudden matter? They don't even rank in the highest casualty or destruction scales. 


They wanted to stick to their guns and force a surrender they still had some sway with. Their actions don't match up with the timing of the bomb drops. When Russia invaded, everything changed. Japan hoped Russia would mediate discussions with the US. When Stalin invaded, that option went down the tube.

Recognizing that the war was totally lost, their interests turned domestic. The high powers had been lying about the war. Germany had just gone through war crimes trials. Their interests were focused on survival. Blaming surrender on this "incredible new weapon" gave them an out with their people. And it sat wonderfully with the US. We had a war ending weapon.

That sounds right.  I was just clarifying that the previous post wasn't saying the Russians had an interest in the results, but that the comment I was replying to was saying the Americans also managed to make a powerful statement to the Russians regarding their capabilities and so a nice clean canvas of a city would really show that off.

It's not exactly a secret that the Japanese treatment of POWs was atrocious, nor is it a secret how much land the Japanese still held at the time of their surrender. [I even have a map of it.](http://historicalresources.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/areas-under-allied-and-japanese-control-august-1945.jpg)

> Even if it IS the entire truth, the reasons being given are pretty weak when it comes to justifying the murder of tens of thousands of civilians.

I can see no other way to end the war with less civilian casualties. Can you?

> Let me ask you this: What if we didn't have "the bomb"? What would have been the best option?

Bombs. Firebombs, specifically. Blockade would cause far too many civilian deaths, and take too long - even more POWs would die in the meantime. At least, if you're talking about ending the war with minimal allied casualties. Without the bomb, the fastest way to get the Japanese to surrender would be invasion, but that would be extremely costly.

>  Would the "best option" have been for us to bomb schools, hospitals, offices, grocery stores...basically just drop all the metal and high explosive we can find on those two cities? 

Well, yes. Because that's what we did with Tokyo.



> And if we wouldn't have been willing walk up and down the streets of Hiroshima individually cutting the throat every Japanese man, woman and child we could find until they surrendered, why is this any better?

Who says we wouldn't have been willing? The Allies were planning to launch an invasion of southern Kyushu known as [Operation Olympic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Operation_Olympic.jpg) on November 1st if the Japanese had not surrendered. 

The bomb was a good way to end the war quickly, which is what the USA had been trying to throughout the whole pacific theater.

It's not about casualties. 

Examine the options. What did the bombing accomplish? We knocked out a city. The existing military forces were unaffected. They were still dug in, they still had enough supplies, they could still fight against US invasion and inflict heavy casualties. And, the Russians could mediate negotiations.

All strategic options were still alive for Japan post-bomb.

When the soviets attacked both options were knocked out. The soviet army was ready to invade the Japanese homeland. Most of the troops had been positioned to defend an allied invasion from the east. Defending against the US might have been possible, but fighting a 2 front war against both the US and the Soviets was not possible. 


Furthermore, back in June, Japan's security council expressed that "The absolute maintenance of peace in our relations with the Soviet Union is imperative for the continuation of the war."

The loss of yet another city at this point was negligible.

Oh yeah, me too. I have to think that the agents on the ground started covering stuff up just in case, and then afterwards (after they strong-armed the body out of Dallas) the word came from higher up to keep a lid on it permanently. This makes sense especially when you consider that a good deal of eyewitness testimony that conflicts with the official report literally comes from other Secret Service agents. I wonder if there was any one person who kinda issued that final approval for the coverup... Wouldn't THAT be a fascinating role for LBJ in this whole mess??

I was talking about the medical experiments, not the actual detaining in camps and killing them off. That's why I brought up Unit 731.

That's no excuse for a complete lack of scientific rigor, or a complete lack of ethics. My field is also quite young; while the physics behind aerospace engineering began hundreds of years ago, the actual science and engineering disciplines involving creating aircraft and spacecraft all obviously happened within the past century or so.  Yet somehow we manage to develop hypotheses that can be confirmed or refuted by actual research, and we manage to create products that can do what they are meant to do in a verifiable way.

No, Luke specifically mentions Biggs having gone off to the Academy.

There are some deleted scenes wherein Luke actually does go to Tosche Station (or maybe Anchorhead) to meet up with some friends, but they were relegated to the cutting room floor.

> In Númenor Sauron also did some kinda evil shit, but not really that evil compared to the rest of the shit he'd pulled

He corrupted the greatest human nation ever, and convinced them to wage war on the gods. It got so bad that God with a capital G had to intervene. That's pretty evil.

I maintain Melkor was trying to free the peoples of Arda from a life of forced allegiance and servitude under the reign of Manwe. Sauron simply continued that role of liberator.

The most important thing to remember about Loki is that he fits the archetype of a *trickster* god.  This makes him a strategist and schemer who prefers to use misdirection to accomplish most of his goals.

**Thor**

At the start of the movie Thor is an arrogant, incompetent, impulsive prick.  He is also set to take the throne of Asgard at a time the Frost giants are getting uppity; as proven by their willingness to launch an attempt to reclaim their most powerful weapon from the Asgardians.

Loki realizes that shit is about to go sideways, in a big way, as soon as Odin goes down for his nap.  Loki needs to neutralize the threat his brother and the frost giants represent to Asgard.  He manipulates the Frost Giants into infiltrating Asgard, thus reminding all Asgardians of the threat the FG represent.  He then manipulates Thor into launching an ill-conceived reprisal against the FG, demonstrating that Thor is unfit to lead Asgard through the coming crisis.  Odin responds by exiling Thor.

With Thor out of the way, Loki then convinces the FGs' leader to attempt to personally assassinate Odin.  He "catches" the FGs in the act and kills their leader.  With the assassination attempt as justification, he then launches an all out assault on the FGs using the Rainbow Bridge as a death ray.

If things had gone *exactly* as Loki planned Thor would simply have languished in exile, while the FGs got decimated as an example to any other potential trouble makers.  The cosmos would have realized that you do not screw around while King Loki is on the throne, and peace would have reigned throughout the Nine Realms.

Unfortunately for everyone, the traitorous "Warriors Three", in direct violation of a royal edict, sneak down to Earth to convince Thor to return and usurp the Throne.  At that point Thor and his friends have become a threat to cosmic security, and Loki has no choice but to unleash The Destroyer in an attempt to neutralize them.  Tragically this has the unforeseeable side effect of Thor regaining his powers and returning to Asgard.  

Thor, genius that he is, decides he has to save the FGs from his brother's 'evil schemes'.  He accomplishes this by *smashing his own people's strategic transportation infrastructure*.  In an act of truly God-Tier stupidity he spares the FGs the worst of the devastation Loki had planned for them, while simultaneously immobilizing Asgard's armies.  

We later find out (in Thor 2) that a direct consequence of his actions is chaos throughout the nine realms which ultimately required an extensive military campaign to resolve.  Thor is hailed as a hero for leading said campaign, despite the fact that he was a major cause of the problems.  **All of which would have been avoided if everyone had just done what Loki told them to do.**

At the end of Thor, Loki slips away into the wider universe.  Realizing that Asgard's armies are trapped in Asgard, he alone will be free to act to protect the interests of his adopted people.  Pretty quickly he concludes that the Tesseract, a source of limitless energy which is capable of transporting armies across the cosmos, is not safe in the hands of humanity.  We can't control it.  We can't protect it.  And we're using it to make weapons of mass destruction.  However, returning the Tesseract to Odin would both keep it safe and restore mobility to Asgard's forces. 

Cue The Avengers.

Because, by then, he had engaged Luke in combat and felt the dark side possibilities in him with his outbursts of anger. He had probably felt out the other (light) side of the Force in him as well. And, since Luke had been trained how to actually manipulate the Force by Yoda in Empire Strikes Back, he was not just Force-sensitive at this time. He was actively tapping into and using the Force, changing it to adapt to his needs. It's the equivalent of playing Marco Polo in a pool. If you just stay silent there on a rubber float and don't move, the person with their eyes closed might not know you're there. But if you are splashing around creating all sorts of disturbances, (in the Force), then they most certainly will be able to not only sense you but also what direction you may approach from as well. With Luke being so new in the ways of the Jedi, he was probably not able to hide himself as well as more disciplined Jedi. The real question is how does a brand new Jedi take down the two top Sith lords?

Why?

I can recall plenty of land wars in Asia that went the way of the aggressor. Even if we exclude Asian based aggressors there will be plenty of people who have successfully concluded wars in Asia.

Alexander the Great - Conquered the Persian empire as well as quite a few other territories in Asia.

Ptolomy/Antigonus - Won several battles/wars during the successor wars.

Philip V of Macedonia - Took possession of parts of one of Ptolomies descendants during the second Macedonian war, tough he ultimately lost against Rome.

Roman Generals with success in Asia.

Scipio Africanus - Syrian War

Sulla - Mithradic war

Pompey Magnus - Mithradic war (again), as well as a shitload of other wars

Ceasar - Civil War

Augustus - Civil War 2, Wars against the Parthians

And several more including the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) who had about 1000 years of wars against Asian powers, and quite often came out on top.

Gonna skip to more modern times now.

Muscovite/Russian conquest of a shitload of land.

British Conquest of India.

Dutch colonisation/conquest of Java and other territories.

Spanish yada yada of Philippines.

The Opium war against China.

American subjugation of the Philippines.

World War 2 Pacific Theater including the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

You're assuming that it is the serial killer which defines the term, which is backwards reasoning. The term is made for the serial killer's aspects, a criteria which they either meet or do not. One of the criteria is the cooling off period, which makes them distinct from repeat kills, habitual killers, ritualistic killers, and spree killers.

We can safely say that she was a serial killer due to her matching the following criteria:

Minimum of 3 victims
'Cooling off' period

These are the main identifiers of a serial killer. Granted, after her release, she worked for the state as a poisoner, but before that time she still had her three minimal victims. Her motives are not in question past that point, as she worked for the state in secret. Her actions are the qualifiers, not the motive or the driving force behind them.

To address your statement of
>If someone were to hold a gun to another person's head and force them to perform this or that act, we can't examine those acts the same way that we would if they'd done them of their own volition.

We are not attempting to hold trial, we are classifying actions. We are not casting any form of judgment, simply applying an adjective.

What country are you from? When your country has been invaded and subjected to atrocities, you will hear about it no matter what. In my country (and I believe every country of Western Europe) 14's also the age when we learn about WWII, including the concentration camps. Saw some horrifying footage of of soldiers dropping corpses, with nothing but the skin on their bones, in mass graves. Sure everyone was shocked, but isn't it also part of our duty of remembrance?

I think it's ridiculous to shield children from these horror stories.  The world is full of terror and beauty, man-made and natural.  Kids are more than capable of processing disturbing information.  I believe its better to explain to children why something is so terrible so it becomes a formative experience.  I read *Maus* in sixth grade, and it taught me a lot about what makes a war necessary and the true capabilities of hunan cruelty and heroism.

No, where I am from (near Chicago) it goes:
Pre-school: 3, 4, and 5 years olds (few 3 year olds though, some parents choose two years of preschool and some do one)
Kindergarten: 5-6 year olds (one year of kindergarten)
Primary school: 1st-3rd grade
Middle school: 4th-5th (some schools also include 6th grade here)
Junior high: 6th-8th (a very few schools do 7th-9th)
High school: 9th grade you are a freshmen, 10th your are a sophomore (translate to 'wise fool', they're so fucking cocky), 11th grade is Junior, 12th is senior, if you are held back for a 5th year the joke is that you are a super-senior)

>A New York-born soldier: “The town of Titatia was surrendered to us a few days ago, and two companies occupy the same. Last night one of our boys was found shot and his stomach cut open. Immediately orders were received from General Wheaton to burn the town and kill every native in sight; which was done to a finish. About 1,000 men, women and children were reported killed. I am probably growing hard-hearted, for I am in my glory when I can sight my gun on some dark skin and pull the trigger."

It's not totally relevant, and only a million or so Filipinos were killed in that war, but I felt that it's worth reinforcing that any peoples can commit atrocities in the right situation.

>The first shot was fired by Sergeant. His target was a mere (small) boy, who was coming down the mountain path. 

>The shooting attracted the villagers, who came out of their homes in alarm. They did not display a weapon, made no hostile movement whatsoever, but they were still ruthlessly (cruelly) shot down in cold blood, men, women and children. The poor natives huddled together or fled in terror. Many were pursued and killed on the spot. Two old men, bearing a white flag and clasping hands like two brothers, approached the lines. Their hair was white. They were literally stumbling; they were so feeble under the weight of years (they were so old). To my horror and that of the other men, the order was given to fire and the two old men were shot down in their tracks.”

I think vivisection is commonly held as for research purposes, the process of opening up a body to fix something is surgery.

In the same vein, dissection of a body for the purpose of explaining death is an autopsy, dissection of a body for fun is just dissection.

A great deal of what we know about hypothermia is from the experiments done by Nazis. They were motivated by a desire to find out how to save their soldiers etc, and they were prepared to kill people they saw as lesser to gather that data. While those experiments should never have been done, obviously, if there can be some good salvaged out of that unspeakable evil then surely that is better than just throwing the research away because of how it was obtained. Knowing about hypothermia, for example, could have saved many lives.

I totally understand where you are coming from, though. It is a thorny issue and using the data seems almost to endorse the research, as long as we can hang the person who did it to absolve our species of the guilt afterwards.

Reddit is not here to do your homework for you. The guy is right and you're making yourself look like a dumbass. Do even a cursory examination, such as the Unit 731 wikipedia article, in the section "Surrender and immunity"

>After Imperial Japan surrendered to the Allies in 1945, Douglas MacArthur became the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, rebuilding Japan during the Allied occupation. MacArthur secretly granted immunity to the physicians of Unit 731, including their leader, in exchange for providing America, but not the other wartime allies, with their research on biological warfare.[9] American occupation authorities monitored the activities of former unit members, including reading and censoring their mail.[32] The U.S. believed that the research data was valuable. The U.S. did not want other nations, particularly the Soviet Union, to acquire data on biological weapons.[33]

Good luck finding exhaustive data on every experiment and piece of data regarding classified chemical and biological weapons projects. The best you're going to get are cites saying that the US military believed the information was valuable.

He's not saying that it was ethical. It wasn't. A crime was committed and that was the results. But to not use the information would be wrong. People died for it, and people would die without the information.

It just depends.  There's a lot of reasons you can stop breathing.  The respiratory center in your brain is connected to various chemical receptors in the brain and other parts of the body to tell what the CO2 level is, and some indirect ways of measuring oxygenation.  Trauma to the brain stem will cause one kind of abnormal respiration, while asphyxiation might cause another, and heart attacks can cause still more.  So it really just depends.

Both the Wikipedia articles on [lethal injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_injection#Controversy) and on the [electric chair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_chair#Notable_persons_and_events) mention problems. 

For the lethal injection:

 * there is evidence that anaesthetics in the injection are not enough and the execute while fully paralysed is still aware and in pain. 

 * untrained staff and sometimes hard to hit veins result in sometimes long preparation times. In at least one case it made a second injection necessary when the first failed to kill the execute after 35 minutes.

The electric chair had apparently a lot of botched uses where multiple electrocutions where necessary to kill. Some executes where found to still live only after their execution was officially over (In one case the executor had to be called back from home to address the error). This lead Nebraska to require multiple electrocutions each almost half a minute long to ensure death.

I haven't seen that leak, but that would be very interesting. China is quite a large player in that region, and traditionally their leadership has favoured preserving the status quo so as to keep the region stable. It could be the case that, in playing the status quo off against the effect that North Korea has on the short-term stability of the region, China is beginning to see that dealing with NK is more important to them than preserving the status quo, which would lead to some VERY interesting shifts in the region. I mean, my brief rundown didn't even touch on Japan at all, and you can bet that they wouldn't be happy with China interfering at all.

NK could and would do massive damage before their military failed. Talking in the millions dead within minutes. This is the proverbial knife being held to the throat. There isn't any doubt the north would lose but the cost in human life would be insane.

In addition to the small number of nukes that NK has potentially going missing. The nation is shrouded in such secrecy that it's extremely difficult to pinpoint where the potential warheads are located. I've read about numerous scenarios going down, neither of which is all that beneficial:

-Generals or higher-ups could get access to the warheads when the Kim regime is largely wiped out, and who knows what a rogue official could do with even one warhead.

-Warheads could go missing, be smuggled out, sold to God knows who, etc.

-SK would have to deal with a massive insurgency of brainwashed North Koreans. Think Iraq/Afghanistan on speed, with a much larger stockpile of weapons.

-The South Korean economy would be decimated with the costs of re-educating, reintergrating and rebuilding an entire nation of millions of brainwashed, starving Koreans.

-Huge stockpiles of weapons (small arms particularly) could go "missing", and turn up in any 3rd world shithole civil war/revolution.

-NK citizens could commit "revolutionary suicide" (ala Jim Jones and his cult), either committing mass suicide, or taking out as many SK/US "dogs" as possible. 

With that last scenario I thought about how they could easily lure South Korean troops into a major population zone within NK, with the intention of trapping them there, and setting off a nuke. Think about the casualty rate, the historical significance, and how North Korea would go down in history up there with Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Mao's China. It gives me chills just to think about it.

The UN tried doing something about NK 60 years ago, and it resulted in the current armistice agreement. Would you have us break that agreement?

I've corrected your mishaps **TIME AND TIME AGAIN**. Yes, your speech the last time we discussed these... these... experiments -about 'the Scientific Method' had a number of good points. But the thing is, the research about Hitler's death had already been repeated no less than a dozen times for each and every Death Instance that you went back and 'Tested'.  

I will admit that a number of the other Death Instance Possibilities haven't been tested thoroughly, albeit because they a fair bit more obscure, as well not discounting the fact that walking into the offices of the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna and shooting Hitler with a PT-67SX *"Deathbringer*™*"* Laserrifle would be a trifle obvious.  

But you have been tampering with the most tested portions of the timeline, and I'm getting sick of having to correct it. If I have to shoot *one more* of your fucking observer-clones, I'm not sure exactly what I'll do. Look, if you want to tamper with the Current Timeline (TL 16መc-038ζՋ), please, ***for the love of Herbert***, file a damn proper Timeline Experiment Form (Form 87ፈ-Жደ, and in *Triplicate!*) with the Shadow Proc. *Department of Continuity*.  
Tamper with something new for once. Reading as many of the reports as I do, novelty is something that never gets old here. We are looking for the best possible route of the timeline, but you're just pissing us off.

true that. but we can't tell for sure, because in C&C Red Alert I it isn't really shown how and why Hitler ceased to exist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert#Plot 

so there is a lot possible espcially that a lot of german scientist stay in germany and the allies try to ally (by a lot of different possible means) with germany for the sake of nukes etc...

also hitler vanishes in 1924 which is quite early but not too late to have any influence.

As far as I can remember the first red alert had almost no fan service and had a plot that set it up as a prequel to the first C&C - retconned in later EA published games. Apparently EA thought axe crazy and fan service sells better than having a story.

Spoiler to the connection: The last video of the soviet campaign kills of Stalin with poisoned tea, his assistants Nadia and Kane reveal themselves as part of Nod and make you a figurehead ruler of the Soviet Union until "Nod tires of it". Basically one end of Red Alert 1 was a prequel to C&C1.

So what is your opinion on basically everyone, including Hitler, agreeing that the foundation of Nazism is anti-socialism? That Nazism is the reaction against the Marxists who want to remove the existence of private property and that one of the core tenets of Nazism is the defense of private property?

Why did Hitler gain the support of conservative politicians who even made him part of the government, why didn't the communists gain the support of conservative politicians? Why did Hitler gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany, why didn't the communists gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany?

These facts don't really fit in your narrative, that's why I'm asking these questions.

In my opinion, individuals are equal and should be treated equally, but societies and cultures are not equal and some are better than others.    Head hunters, mayan and aztec cannibals, etc., are not equivalent to european societies.   

When you deconstruct and criticize the historical facts of a europe, remove heros from their shared history and hold those heros responsible for the morals of today, it means to me that you are anti-european.   

Take their treatment of columbus, search on rape murder of columbus.


Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, Steel where the author makes makes every excuse imaginable for 'aboriginals, blacks, Indians,' and other primitive peoples' lack of development and explains the success of anglo saxons on their "luck."

Sure. It basically says bodies had more or less normal level of radiation, clothes samples had somewhat elevated levels of beta-particle radiation which was probably in a form of a contaminated dust or substance because it diminished with thorough washing.

"Could this level of radiation have been present without contact with radioactive substances or environments?" "Not really" On the other hand, they use the word "somewhat elevated" or even "slightly elevated", although later say that their work protocols in the lab require, for example, that even contaminated items have lower levels before washing. So as I get it, their conclusion is "clearly not normal levels, but still just somewhat elevated". There are tables with exact values so if you understand radiation levels you can see for yourself with google translate or something.

First, "Radiation was false" and "Yes, radioactive contamination was detected but it wasn't that big of a deal" are different things. Radiation wasn't false.

Second, yes, it wasn't *that* big of a deal. It's not Chernobyl on their clothes. But neither it is something to hand-wave.

Third, on exactly how big of a deal it was, the report goes:

> "For instance, part N4, a black sweater, at the moment of testing had 9900 beta-particle decays a minute on 150 cm^2, and after thorough washing for 3 hours in our lab it had 5200 decays from the same area. For example I can say that our [lab's] sanitary rules require that beta-particle contamination from 150 cm^2 should not be higher than 5000 decays/min, and after washing it should be equal to normal background state. [...] Your data indicates these clothes were in a water for a long time, i.e. already thoroughly washed though."

> "[Could this contamination have happened without being in a contaminated place or environment]?"

> "Absolutely not."

Another mystery here is why this test was even administered.

I did know about paradoxical undressing and the delusional and sluggish acting, actually. It's something I took into account since it's kindof the logical step, and could very well have happened with them. Also, I live in temperatures that are consistently lower than what was recorded for that night and just minutes outside without proper clothing would not cause delusional hypothermia fast enough for your explanation to make sense.

It is not in tatters, it's covered with snow but standing. For example, [Brusnikin](https://sites.google.com/site/hibinaud/home/dopros-svidetela-brusnicina) (one of those who was first handling it) testifies that "It was covered with packed snow", and then goes on to wonder that something extraordinary must have happened if all hikers left the safest place around, the tent. In other words, after seeing and personally taking apart the tent, he (a hiker himself) did not as much as have a thought of avalanche as a reason.

> Около 7 часов что-то необычное еще никем не виданное заставило туристов в панике покинуть палатку. Бежать разутыми, при плохой погоде ночью из единственного теплого уголка возможно только под страхом смерти.

"At around 7 o'clock something unusual, never before seen, made the hikers leave the tent. Running bare legged, in a bad weather at night, from the only warm place around - this is possible only under the fear of death."

> Это странное явление (свет, проникающий через палатку, звук, возможно и газы) действовало в течение продолжительного промежутка времени, подгоняя туристов.

"This strange phenomenon (light shining through the tent, sound, or perhaps some gas) continued to act for a while, hastening the hikers."

Those are of course wild guesses, but if the tent was destroyed he'd say "the tent was obviously destroyed by an avalanche, so that's why they left".

Another one of those who handled it, [Tempalov, says](https://sites.google.com/site/hibinaud/home/dopros-svidetela-tempalova-v-i):

> Остальных 4 студентов обнаружить не удается по настоящее время так как в горах имеется очень большой и толстый снег.

"The rest 4 students [corpses] could not be located as of yet, because there's a lot of very thick snow in the mountains". Indeed all the corpses that were located save for 2, were covered by thick snow.

> Палатка была растянута на лыжах и палках, забитых в снег, вход ее был обращен в южную сторону, и с этой стороны растяжки были целы, а растяжки палатки с северной стороны были сорваны и вся вторая половина палатки была занесена снегом.

"The tent was set up on ski poles stuck into snow, its entrance facing south, and from that side its ridgepoles were fine. Ridgepoles from the north side were torn out and that part of the tent was covered by the [falling] snow".

By the way, Brusnikin in his report says the same and adds that "one of the ski poles, probably the one from the north side, was inside the tent, sawed into pieces. They must have had some serious reason to do so, because they had no spares."

And again Tempalov:

> На первый взгляд палатка была занесена снегом.

"First impression is that the tent was covered by the [falling] snow". He uses the word "занесена" again which assumes normal ways by which the snow accumulates (falls from the sky, slowly arrives with wind etc).

> Никаких следов борьбы в палатке мною не установлено. Если бы была какая либо борьба естественно, что-то бы мной было установлено. 

"I found no signs of struggle in the tent. If there was any fighting, of course I'd notice something." I'm not sure why he repeats that but anyway, if the tent was destroyed, signs of fighting would probably be out of question.

That's what I'm saying. His manifesto doesn't present anything "new". His ideas are as old as philosophy. Reading it is kind gives you an idea why the guy snapped. If he thought he came up with some brilliant idea and that no one was listening to him, it was because his discovery is an elementary concept. 

 I'd rather read Asimov, at least his stuff is fun. Might actually form your own opinion on the fate of technology and Man too.

His writing is impressive in the sense that it is one of the most lucid, albeit not very logical or convincing explanations of his motivations, offering a little glimpse into the descent into madness of a man who captured the imagination of a country for many years. I like to think I am well read, and it certainly didn't feel like a waste of time reading that.

Or...maybe...someone widely read decided to read the manifesto one day just to see what was going on inside the mind of a famous maniac.  You can read it in one session easily.

Mein Kampf is an awful book filled with bad history and nonsense, yet no one gets shat in for reading that....and Hitler was a but more destructive than Ted.

Well in this case that's exactly what was done. Ted was a terrorist, but the nyt gave in to his demands and published the manifesto so he would stop killing. Not only did he stop the murders, the publication directly led to his arrest after the writing style was recognised. 

I also disagree that reading it now would have a similar moral consequence. I read mein kampf too, and I don't think that validated Hitler.

Once again, I will say this:

It doesn't matter.  It's an ATOMIC BOMB for fuck sake.  It's not a rifle shot.  It's not going to be a precise strike, regardless of the intended target.  EVERYTHING within a half-mile will be VAPORIZED.  It doesn't matter what your target was.  Severe structural damage occurs for a radius of up to 3 miles.  Severe sunburn for 5 miles.  It's FUCKING NUCLEAR WAR!  

No, they didn't purposely target the hospital, the bomb likely got drifted of targed by surface winds.  But, it doesn't matter.  The people at the Hospital died 1/400 millionth of a second faster then they would have otherwise.  That's the only difference it makes.  

Hence the saying, *"Close only counts in three things:  Horseshoes, Hand Grenades, and Nuclear War."*

> The US Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that, even without the use of the atomic bombs, without the Soviet Union entering the war and without an Allied invasion of Japan, the war would have ended before December 31, 1945 and, in all likelihood, before November 1, 1945.

This is what i came up with, i remember on the natgeo doc they had the same thought but a different source.

Also: 
>Prior to the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the US was destroying Japanese cities at will with conventional bombs.

Its strange how people convict the US for using the nukes while we forget about all the other bombings of Japanese and German cities. Just goes to show I guess how history is written by the victors.

The Japanese controlled parts of mainland China during WW2. The Russians launched a land invasion of Manchuria on August 9, 1945. This was literally three days after Hiroshima. I just wanted to explain why I think people downvoted you. On the flip side, your information about the USSR navy (or lack of navy) shows how much of a pain it would be to invade the mainland.

Who's to say a drawn out invasion would have happened?  The Japanese Imperial forces at the time predicted a USSR invasion in 1949, and the US was kicking thier asses 6 ways from Sunday already.  They were on the brink of surrender anyhow.  Deploying atomic bombs was not necessary to give them a surrender.  Once they actually did surrender, we basically gave them everything they wanted.  It was far from "unconditional".  Hirohito remained Emperor of Japan until his death in 1989.

Japan wanted to surrender 3 weeks before we even struck as the "ultimatum", and we basically gave them everything that they wanted.  They did not surrender unconditionally.  Hirohito remained as emperor.  he had to renounce god-ship, but I'm under the impression that the Japs accepted that he only did that because he was quite literally held under the point of a gun.  Shinto is still a major religion in Japan today.

> Furthermore, back in June, Japan's security council expressed that "The absolute maintenance of peace in our relations with the Soviet Union is imperative for the continuation of the war."


And yet even then the War Minister and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the Navy continued to hold out.

> Togo replied vigorously that Japan's position was so precarious that if she even attempted to propose a number of conditions, the Allies would in all probability refuse to negotiate at all. General Umezu, the Army Chief of Staff, contended that Japan had still not lost the war and that if the enemy invaded the homeland, Japanese troops were still capable of holding him back and perhaps even repulsing him; the cost, in enemy losses, would be tremendous. To this Togo replied that even if a first assault failed, Japan's power to defend herself would be even further diminished, and that a second enemy attack would almost certainly not fail. Japan, said Togo, must accept the Potsdam ultimatum now, demanding no more than the preservation of the Imperial House.

> By then it was one o'clock. The Council had been in session for two hours, and although word had arrived of the bombing of Nagasaki and of the fact that Manchuria, for all practical purposes, was in Soviet hands, the Council was still not able to reach an agreement. The line of demarcation was as sharply drawn as ever, with three on one side and three on the other. Suzuki proposed that the Council adjourn, to reconvene later in the day, after the afternoon's Cabinet meeting. That is how the Thursday morning session of the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War ended in Tokyo.


--

> "We cannot pretend," said General Anami, summing up the arguments on the other side, "to claim that victory is certain, but it is far too early to say that the war is lost. That we will inflict severe losses on the enemy when he invadesJapan is certain, and it is by no means impossible that we may be able to reverse the situation in our favor, pulling victory out of defeat.

> "Furthermore," Anami went on, "our Army will not submit to demobilization. Our men simply will not lay down their arms. And since they know they are not permitted to surrender, since they know that a fighting man who surrenders is liable to extremely heavy punishment, there is really no alternative for us but to continue the war."

Yes I am wrong about the nuclear weapons part, I am sorry I didn't backcheck my information. But after the first bomb was dropped, Japan had 24 hours to surrender before the next one was dropped, they refused and little boy was dropped, thus the bombing only took 2 days.

Just pointing out that we seem to fetishize the nuclear bombings as a particularly cruel act of war due to the nature of the weapon used, but ignore the conventional bombings in WWII that claimed the lives of far more civilians, which we tend to accept as a relatively normal part of warfare because they were conducted with weapons familiar to us rather than something novel and terrifying.

How am I wrong? Look at what the Japanese did to the Chinese. Do you think they would have been kinder to the US? They started the war, unprovoked. The US found a way to end the war swiftly without losing one more American life. I think the decision was 100% justifiable.

Japan was presented with the option of unconditional surrender July 27th. Their government effectively said they were going to ignore the ultimatum and keep fighting. The first atomic bomb was dropped 10 days later. They had a chance but refused to surrender. If the Japanese had developed the bomb first (and they were working on that), I suspect they would have used it. Why would the US forgo a swift end to the war when they could end it in days, rather than months?

To answer your question no, I'm not standing behind any of the unethical experiments that took place back then, or on any innocent humans, in fact I don't even stand behind the death penalty. I feel like it's an interesting topic for moral discussion however, so let me put out a hypothetical.

Using the current US judicial system let's say prisoner X has been convicted, sentenced to death, unsuccessfully appealed, and is due for execution, all hope lost.  At the point of execution, an ultimatum is presented to Mr. X, either die here on the table today, or live and give yourself up to experimental science. In this scenario the test subject is guaranteed anesthesia, painkillers, etc, as to make them as comfortable as possible during the experiments, but no guarantees on safety. What choice do you take? What choice would the majority of inmates take? Does a convicted rapist or torturer of innocents deserve the painkillers? Do they deserve the right to choose? Is it more "humane" to offer this option? Would giving yourself up to the science be "heroic?" Could society actually end up benefitting from the souls we currently kill bury and forget?

**Psychiatry** is the medical specialty devoted to the study and treatment of mental disorders. These mental disorders include various affective, behavioural, cognitive and perceptual abnormalities. The term was first coined by the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808, and literally means the 'medical treatment of the mind' (psych-: mind; from Ancient Greek psykhē: soul; -iatry: medical treatment; from Gk. iātrikos: medical, iāsthai: to heal). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a psychiatrist.

**The Avengers**

At the start of the Avengers our hero, Loki, is in a tough spot.  He needs to get the Tesseract from Earth to Asgard, but he's got little to work with other than some magic and his own considerable wits.  Unfortunately, Thanos, a well known cosmic ne're-do-well has learned of the Tesseract's location on Earth.

Loki decides to do what he does best, offer his the enemies of Asgard a deal, just so he can stab them in the back.  He approaches Thanos and promises to get him the Tesseract in exchange for weapons, troops, and ownership of the Earth.  This accomplishes two things, it provides Loki with the material resources he needs to take the Tesseract away from the ignorant humans who are fiddling with it, and it keeps Thanos from launching a more effective operation on his own.

Prior to contacting Thanos, Loki likely conducted a strategic assessment of Earth forces.  It becomes clear through the events of the movie that he knew about all of shield's assets, he knew about the hulk, and he knew about Iron Man.  It also becomes clear that he deliberately under-reports the strength of Earth's forces to Thanos, whose henchman even states, "The humans were not the weaklings we had been lead to believe."

As the movie unfolds, Loki deliberately baits all of the heroes into action.  He kidnaps and brainwashes Hawkeye, ensuring both Hawkeye and Black widow will be personally invested in the final fight.  He starts stomping around Europe and pontificating like a wanna-be dictator, which ensures Captain America will want a piece of the action ("The last time I saw a man standing above everyone else, we had a disagreement.").  

He uses the scepter to trigger Banner's transforming into the Hulk.  He sets up shop *on top of Stark Tower*.  We know from Thor that he can hide from Baldur's magic omni-vision, but somehow Odin still learns what he's up to and sends Thor down to Earth to retrieve him.  

Loki is a master manipulator; none of this is coincidence or accident.  Despite having a history of stealthy actions and indirect scheming, he spends the whole movie putting on a show.  Stark even calls him a "full-tilt diva" and refers to the final fight as "opening night".  Loki does everything he can to bring the team together, short of shouting "Avengers Assemble"!

Finally, think about what Loki brings to the Battle of New York.  The worm-hole he opens with the Tesseract is too small to function as anything other than a strategic bottle neck.  At most, a couple of hundred Chitauri make it through, and those aren't very impressive.  

I mean, come on, Hawkeye manages kill dozens with a freaking *bow and arrows*.  Sure, he's a 'superhero', but his superpower is basically just being really good in combat.  Think about it for a moment and you'll realize, Earth's conventional military forces would have made minced-meat out of the Chitauri as soon as they arrived on scene.  

Worst case scenario (which almost happened), the Avengers fail and someone nukes NY.  Even that would have sent a strong deterrent message, to anyone from another planet, thinking of conquering the Earth.  Loki would have just dug the Tesseract out of the rubble, and used it to return to Asgard.  

Then at the end, Loki is beaten and surrenders.  This guy can turn invisible and create whole armies of illusory copies of himself.  He could have snuck away if he wanted too.  He doesn't, because for him it's "mission accomplished".  He's going home with the Tesseract, and that's what he wanted from the start.

In the final analysis, the outcome of Loi's actions are dozens (maybe hundreds) dead in NY, and a crap load of property damage.  However, Earth and Asgard are both safer than if Loki had done nothing.  Again, that's not a coincidence or an accident.  

And it's not just Earth and Asgard.  Thanos is a genocidal maniac.  There is no telling how much damage he could have done if he had gotten his hands on the Tesseract.  **Loki saved countless worlds, and did it while playing the villain.  He did it, expecting no thanks or reward.  He did it, just because it needed to be done.  That's real heroism, and it's head and shoulders above Thor's accomplishments.**

I don't know if you actually came up with that yourself or just copied the ideas from somewhere (because that's how reddit usually works), but that's brilliant.  If it is your idea, thank you very much, now I have a legitimate reason to like Loki better than Thor, other than just because he's more interesting.

I'm pretty sure Dad is the asshole there. In that era, women weren't known for having a lot of autonomy. If Joe said "no one goes to see her," then no one does.

There was definite talking, but the quality wasn't very good, and I don't remember paying attention to anything in specific. I ended up paying attention more to the fact that he was otherwise lively, didn't seem depressed, which made his desire to die seem more like a mental disease and Miewes was more like a predator taking advantage of a sick person. 

We watched a little bit after Brandes died, not much though. At a certain point, it's just egregious. Too much to watch for no point. And Miewes appeared very happy with himself, which made it way more uncomfortable to sit through. It's not like he was sick and couldn't control himself. Brandes was distinctly not in control and needed coaxing. Miewes was just so smug.

> The colosseum was in use from roughly 80 AD until the early medieval period for entertainment purposes, including gladiatorial combat as well as simulated sea battles. Within a single 123 day span, in 107 AD, 11,000 animals and 10,000 humans were involved in events.

Yes, but the 10.000 humans were not all killed during the events. Gladiators were trained professionists/slaves with a high cost of training. Kill them in a shot was not a good idea.

The idea of actual death in arenas is similar to believe to John Cena injured arms.

I remember reading somewhere that at first some of the lower level scientists were horrified by the experiments but made to continue. After the third or fourth, they got used to it. Somehow that's more horrifying, that ordinary people will go through with orders like that and become monsters so quickly. But don't quote me on it.

EDIT: I read it on the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731):

>In 2007, the Japanese army surgeon Ken Yuasa testified to the Japan Times that, "I was afraid during my first vivisection, but the second time around, it was much easier. By the third time, I was willing to do it." He believes at least 1,000 people, including surgeons, were involved in vivisections over mainland China.

Human advancement away from the need to be so close and personal to many tasks has caused a shelter effect for many. This is especially true for western countries. Being so removed causes an inability to handle gruesome facts, which in turn causes them to feel someone younger cannot handle it since them, as an adult, cannot handle it. 

I too believe we should not shield children from the truth or the world. Better to know what exists of is possible than to not and pay for it later. It makes us more understanding as people besides.

Well just in terms of how good the movie is (again, history aside), I'd put Braveheart in a class waaayyy above 300. Not that 300 was bad, but it just wasn't on Braveheart's level in nearly any way in my opinion. 

That said I am confused about them making a sequel. I was under the impression that the story had pretty much come to a close.

Effective at it's general purpose, to force a person to give information they don't want to. If done correctly, you'll get people to tell you from how they were the ones to kill Hitler to how they trained Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot a gun in Boy Scouts despite being born in 1982.

I have to think that more people in China would probably support it vs. South Korea.  Having talked to some young people who are no longer in Korea, they seem to think it would be a bad idea to reunify, as south would have to support the north.

It's common sense that a nation that has been thriving without its other half would want little to nothing to do with reintegrating 24 million undeveloped, brainwashed, backward people. You look at the figures at completely reeducating a population which largely hates you, and the trouble is way more than it's worth.

The land is supposedly cursed due to certain actions by the family who owned it originally. Other than that, there's been murders around the park, and not to mention the Hollywood sign suicides which is pretty close.

Personally I've seen the ghost of the actress who jumped off the sign. Group of friends and I thought it be a wonderful idea to go up to the sign at 2am (sober). I, being a fan of everything paranormal, decided to venture ahead. Lo and behold, saw a white shade moving slowly to me. I ended up nope-ing out of there, along with my friends.

Other experiences ranges from cold spots (78 degrees at night during the summer and out of nowhere 54?), shadows moving around, and suddenly a dreadful feeling(usually around the abandon zoo).

I know I didn't give much detail, but if it matters, my family dabbled in Santeria since the 70's and their parents long before that. I'm a rational person, but the shit I've seen in my childhood and now adult life makes it easier for myself to "see" what others cannot. Whether it's a gift or curse, I managed to survive a few fatal instances.

> So what is your opinion on basically everyone, including Hitler, agreeing that the foundation of Nazism is anti-socialism?

1.) Hitler was not against international socialism because of the economic theory of international socialism. Hitler was against international socialism because of its internationalist nature and that it claimed all races are equal (pretty much the only thing communism got right). Hitler believed that Germans (arians) are racially superior to other "races". This was the primary reason Hitler was against communism. He had no problem with the economic theory of communism.

2.) Why would someone who bases his party's *foundation* on anti-socialism call his party *"National Socialist German Workers' Party"* - don't you find this just a little bit weird?

>That Nazism is the reaction against the Marxists who want to remove the existence of private property and that one of the core tenets of Nazism is the defense of private property?

Indeed, fascism was a reaction to Marxism, that's perfectly clear. But not because of capitalism vs. communism, as in the economic theory, but because of the fact that as said above, communism was an internationalist movement while fascists claimed that the particular ethnic group they belonged to was superior to others. It was the race thing that set them apart and not the economic thing.

The thing about private property: Private property only exists if no outside force can confiscate it for whatever reason. Nazism, like communism, is a collectivist ideology that states that the individual can be sacrificed for the good of the group. i.e. if confiscating your property by force and at your expense is deemed to be beneficial for a larger group of people then it's perfectly justified. Nazis had no problem with this, they just didn't went as far as the communists but they came pretty close.

Just ask the jews (and any other persons/groups that the ruling party didn't like for whatever arbitrary reasons) how their private property was defended. This is also how it began in communism: First only the property of the state's "enemies" was confiscated, eventually it happened to everyone.

>Why did Hitler gain the support of conservative politicians who even made him part of the government, why didn't the communists gain the support of conservative politicians? 

Because the conservative politicians, like Hitler, were nationalists and believed in the supremacy of Germany and wanted to revenge Germany's defeat in the previous war. Communists, on the other hand, were internationalists and didn't care if Germany as a country lost or won, as they didn't really care about any other arbitrarily drawn lines on the map either.

>Why did Hitler gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany, why didn't the communists gain the support of the biggest capitalists of Germany?

Because under Nazism those capitalists were de facto made part of the government. Their factories basically supplied all the goods and services needed for the German war machine. Those companies completely depended on the government and had the government as their main client. 

However, they weren't really private companies de facto, as it wasn't like they could do whatever they want. They still had to execute whatever the party told them to execute and produce whatever the party told them to produce. They were basically an unofficial branch of the government.

In other words, they were de jure privately owned companies however de facto they were state controlled and centrally commanded businesses. From here it just takes one step towards communism. The economy of Nazi Germany was as far as it could get from free market capitalism.

You can like it or not, fascism and Nazism aren't the polar opposites to communism. They are obviously not the same however they aren't as far away from each other as one might think.

In seriousness though, documenting things should be for history should be accurate. Going out of your way to point out hitlers better achievements seems odd to me, in the context of the posts.

An avalanche may not have necessarily impacted their tent. Whatever forced them to leave the tent was likely loud. I don't see why they would cut their way out of a tent if they saw some light outside (as missile test theories tend to go).

I've never seen a better theory than avalanche. It doesn't fit *every* piece of evidence, but it fits most.

>[T]he system cannot be reformed in such a way as to reconcile freedom with technology. The only way out is to dispense with the industrial technological system altogether. This implies revolution, not necessarily an armed uprising, but certainly a radical and fundamental change in the nature of society.

Uhm, if that's his main thesis, then he's peddling defeatist bullshit. Just because you don't know how to do something, doesn't mean there exists no way to do it. That annoys me so much, I'm going to read the rest and see if his reasons diverge into what I feel like they are going to :/

The idea that the increase of technology as it occurs today inherently restricts our freedoms.  The most recent example of this being PRISM, but he gives older examples.

From what i recall of his manifesto the guy thought black people couldn't ever integrate into white society and that "dem evil liberals" had the gaul to try to help them with school subsidies and fair wages. It is his assumption that without white intervention the american black people would always be violent and irresponsible.

The whole social darwinism thing has been thought up by so many people. That was TK's jam. There is nothing original about him, except that he went nuts and started sending out bombs. If he hadn't killed people no one would even talk about his theories. But people love a sensational story.

No, i'm not saying that. I'm saying that killing people should never ever be a way of getting attention for your point. Maybe the point is super reasonable, maybe it makes sense; but if you're killing people to prove that point it totally invalidates you (as far as i'm concerned).

If we start giving time to these people then we're paying the bloody ransom. If we do this then it becomes a legitimate tactic and terrorists can quite logically start commiting acts to further a political agenda.

As far as i'm concerned if you kill someone you're a nutter who deserves to be ignored. I don't want to know your name, I don't want to know what you stand for - I just want you far, far away from me.

If you've got a point; make it... but please, don't kill anyone!

Look, you can continue on as a revisionist historian about how inhumane the nuclear detonations were, and you'd be right. It was inhumane. But unfortunately it was necessary. In war, you generally want to avoid deaths of your own soldiers, the alternative to the use of nukes was a fullscale land invasion, and at the time, the Japanese were known for their incredible adherence to codes of honor to the point of killing themselves if they failed. 

So, try to look at it through the US Governments eyes. "We have a weapon that could knock another nation out of the war without the loss of any of our own troops through its use. We either use it, or invade the Japanese mainland, which may prove to be very drawn out and lead to countless deaths."

Even with what I know now, I'd still use one of those Nukes. Only one, because I believe it would only have taken one to end the war. At the time however the US wanted to give the impression that it had many of these weapons, and that if the Japanese continued, the US would continue nuking them until there was nothing left of the landscape.

Say what you will, it ended the war, roughly 140,000 people died and Japan as a nation changed for the better. I don't know what a full-scale land invasion would have achieved, but I don't care, I KNOW a nuke would knock Japan out of the war, and so in that position, I'd make the same decision. 

The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were a question of necessity, not how humane it would be. The Japanese had already proved themselves QUITE inhumane themselves through their treatment of the Chinese during that war.

The same US strategic bomb survey says in literally the next paragraph that that only would have happened if we had kept up a constant stream of carpet bombing that would have led to losses of life hundreds of thousands times more than the atomic drops, and that in this case the atom bomb was the lesser of two evils.

edit: and there was carpet bombings on both sides of the war, the Japanese did it to the US the Soviets, and the Chinese, the Chinese were also horribly experimented on, the US threw American citizens in camps, the soviets killed millions of ethnically diverse people, and the Germans fire bombed the Brits and had a disagreement with the Jews. Nobody was innocent in that war. Atrocity came from both sides, but the dropping of the bombs was not a cruel or heinous act, well it was, but not because the US didn't have to. The Japanese were preparing their citizens for a full on invasion, they have said and there were multiple documents found that confirm the Japanese were not going to surrender until we had decimated every thing they had, the bombs just proved the US would and could do it.

> Once they actually did surrender, we basically gave them everything they wanted

We absolutely did not. The War Minister, and the Chief of Staff for the Army and Navy wanted far more than preserving the imperial polity.

>Suzuki, Togo, and Yonai favored acceptance of the Allied ultimatum with the single proviso relating to the Imperial polity. The other three--War Minister Anami and the two Chiefs of Staff, Umezu for the Army and Toyoda for the Navy--wanted to propose conditions: a minimal occupation force, trying of war criminals by Japan rather than by the enemy, and demobilization of Japanese troops by Japanese officers. Anami and the two Chiefs of Staff were unable, apparently, to accept the idea of either defeat or surrender, both of which went against all their training; these proposals, thus, were aimed at minimizing, perhaps even denying, the fact of both defeat and surrender.

Truman had warned them before the nuke to surrender, fact is they weren't  going out without a fight. Who knows how long an invasion would have lasted or whether or not it would have. If it did, it would cost a lot and would have probably taken more lives. Fact is we didn't take the chance and whether or not we saved lives is still debated. 

We didn't attack Japan to know how powerful our nukes were, we had launched a plutonium bomb previously and had brilliant scientists working on the bomb, they knew precisely much damage it would do before they dropped it.

Where do you live? In New Zealand nuclear history (other than our protests) isn't taught 'cause it's not relevant (This did not stop me teaching myself everything about Hiroshima for one assignment. So worth it, got the best grade possible), and as a history major at uni I'm probably going to do some stuff on nuclear history.

Another factor is your teachers bias and what they enjoy teaching. My history teacher taught us early NZ history cause he liked it, but when I get my teaching degree I will probably include Japan v America in my WWII unit.

Because the "horror story" of nuclear weapons fits perfectly into everyone's hands. The U.S. intimidated Russia, and pretty much the entire world, with this new weapon. And Japan, who had been lying to its people about how well the war was going, could blame their surrender on this weapon of mass destruction.

I think USA had it's own reasons for wanting to get into the war, and it had it's own reasons for wanting to take out Japan. [It's not even nailed down as certain about whether USA knew about the Pearl Harbor attack](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8932197/Pearl-Harbour-memo-shows-US-warned-of-Japanese-attack.html).

I don't honestly know enough about US history, I just think that history is taught in schools in a particular way for a reason. It seems that far more people in the past were against the nuking of Japan than are now, and that the younger people have accepted that it was the right thing to do.

Come on, the Japanese might well have been sat around thinking that USA might attack, and look at what they might do to us! We have to end the war with them swiftly so they can't do us any harm!

There's always two sides, just not in school history, haha.

What country ever would want to accept an unconditional surrender anyway? That's just a daft argument. 

In my opinion, I think it's a matter of principle that you don't attack civilians. If you start leaving your principles at home, then in the heat of the moment you can do something really bad. That's all there is to it, in my opinion.

Part of that is not telling every single person involved what is going on. 

So just because no one told you that they had made a decision to bomb the embassy, doesn't mean they didn't. 

I'm not saying they did or didn't, but none of the facts you present alter that. 

Also, do you not think the intelligence services are aware of what targets to avoid and have them marked on those maps too? Like hospitals, schools, embassies?

Yes, but no where near the level of research and tests done at unit 731, which was my original point. The horrors there were much worse, though if we are going off of numbers, the holocaust doesn't even have it in the bag, which is why I also brought up Stalin and Mao who seem to get a free pass in terms of evil people. Yet Hitler is still painted as the worst person to ever exist, which was my other gripe. He just isn't.

That's all well and fine, but as neither of us are FBI agents, nor (I assume?) do we have access to such agents, it would be best to refer to definitions of the terms used as they are.

I'm not sure about what you meant in your comment, but if your goal was to say "that's a shame education is not more global" then I agree. I'd have liked to learn about Unit 731 and Shiro Ishii before I discovered Reddit and TIL. Hell, there are a hundred facts I learnt about my country that are less historically important than the Nankin Massacre, and still during the many lessons that I took on WWII, never once was it mentionned.

I can't speak to how history is taught today, but when I was in high school in the late 80s, we learned fuck all about the atrocities of war and the things that out own country did to it's citizens. When My dad told me about the internment camps here in the US, I couldn't believe we weren't taught about those, so that was what I wrote my history paper about. Not a popular decision, but I was angry that it had been purposely omitted from pretty much everything in school. The number of other students who thought I'd just made it up was surprising. 

I got a great grade in that class, but seriously, we spent two weeks talking about the Panama Canal and two days about the Civil War. It was weird.

To be fair a lot of eastern countries don't have a problem with shielding children, as they just keep the entire populace in the dark.  That said, I don't think western countries shield so much, as there are certain things that are stressed in education.  I mean it might not make sense to teach calculus at too young an age, as there may not be the requisite understanding by most of the students.  Are there young people who learn it? Yes.  And I think those able to handle it will step forward somehow.  I remember when I first heard about Pythagoras (the right angle rule), and mentioned to my teacher that I thought there must be some relationship for other angles, but that through a lot of testing I wasn't able to get it exactly... 

In any case the fact that some middle school child was in fact able to find the material, and was more advanced, as evidenced by whatever this "TAG" program is.   Just my 2 cents.

It's not really circular. The data is unethical to obtain first hand, and so they didn't, but they didn't get it first hand so they didn't need to do the unethical act to obtain it.

The **Collinwood school fire** (also known as the **Lake View School fire**) of Ash Wednesday, March 4, 1908, was one of the deadliest disasters of its type in the United States. 172 students, two teachers and a rescuer were killed in the conflagration in Collinwood, Ohio, a community that has since been absorbed into the city of Cleveland.

Yes, certain chemicals (eg Morphine) could be used to kill someone through overdose.

European countries ban the import of suppliers who allow any of their medication to be used in executions.  Some of those restrictions extend even to a company owning a portion of another company that supplies chemicals for execution.  

The market for medical morphine is drastically larger than the market for morphine used in execution.  

Some of the chemicals currently used in lethal injection are very hard to come by right now as it's simply not a profitable business.

With the amount of people surviving suicide, the lack of trained anaesthetists present mentioned by Wikipedia and their problems with basic things like finding a vein to inject into, it is unlikely that they would get that right. Also no company producing a sedative would want their product to be mentioned as the lethal component of the injection - it would be a marketing nightmare ( just as having electric chairs run on alternating and not direct current was a marketing move ).

I am South Korean, and my family wants the reunification of the North and South. Sure, it's going to be expensive and difficult, but it's something that has to be done.

I also don't think the North hates the South. I've read the AMA's NK refugees and it seems the atmosphere there is, "Anything is better than here." Also, as a Korean, I'm probably more exposed to Korean-related news, so when I see the meeting days between the two, they're very emotional. We are a very prideful people.

I came back today to add the thought that I don't believe you that you have a mood disorder.  If you did then you might object to people taking outlier symptoms described only with the heavy use of qualifiers, and applying them universally to all people with a mood disorder so common that it's nearly ubiquitous in every social setting.  

The fact that you and your gang have gone through this thread violating reddiquette to stilt your own opinion with downvotes rather than behave like sensible people only further entrenches my perspective.

See, were you actually a person with a mood disorder then you might object to the stigma of your condition being worsened intentionally just so that some unsolved case wrapped in urban legend could be explained.  You might have a more meaningful objection than to split hairs over somebody's word choice.  That's what we call "grasping at straws".

The only reason that I have come back to state this is that after a day's thought about this discussion, I figure that if I'm wrong then you might want it pointed out that you're acting against your own best interest.  More likely, you're just a troll pretending to be an expert in a condition you don't have while you're not a psychiatrist and have apparently never been in a position to learn about it for the benefit of anybody close to you.

At least your user name is accurate.

**I** have bipolar disorder, and again, it's an oversimplification because people won't read a novel on the Internet; especially when being corrected.

No, simplification is not damaging to us.  Having people misunderstand what we live with, who we are, and what that can mean to those whose lives we are a part of *does* have an effect on us.  Say, people might start believing that hallucinations are part of the diagnostic criteria for a *mood disorder* and then refuse to hire us.  Frankly, the stigma is bad enough without people spreading bullshit, and I can explain in what way it is better to understate than to overstate the condition's characteristics.

All that matters where people without the disorder are concerned is how we will seem in our affect.  Nothing beyond that has any bearing on their lives whatsoever.  Look at it through the lens of somebody doing the hiring some place.  They need to know that some days you'll seem down but will be able to push yourself into gear.  That's it.  That's all they need.

What they *don't* need are a bunch of conspiracy theorists, in attempt to explain some pop culture mystery, running around online taking wild guesses that everybody with bipolar disorder hallucinates and suffers from delusions, with or without the justification of rare outliers who also suffer from a comorbid psychotic condition.  That is why I said something, and I don't appreciate straws being grasped at to make me look wrong over something so incredibly simple and obvious that there's no gain and no need for it.

> 2.) Why would someone who bases his party's foundation on anti-socialism call his party "National Socialist German Workers' Party" - don't you find this just a little bit weird?

Good question. Why would anyone who bases his party on anti-socialism call his party the "National Socialist Germany Workers' Party"? According to Hitler:

>"Why," I asked Hitler, "do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?"

> "Socialism," he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, pugnaciously, "is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.

> "Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic."

From an interview Hitler did.

So Hitler thought that communists, Marxists, all kinds of socialists who were against the institution of private property were not real socialists. They were people who stole the word socialist. Note that at the time and today, the definition of socialism was basically 'a revolutionary against the capitalist institution of private property'. Wanting to change the meaning of socialism from 'against private property' to 'being nationalist and for private property' is a pretty big change, don't you agree?

At the time in Germany, socialism was immensely popular. The number one political party was the conservative party. The number two was often the communist party. Calling yourself socialist was a PR move, just like using the color red and appropriating other words used by socialists and communists. The clearest case of this was the Spanish fascist party the Falange, where they simply said: "the anarchist flag was red and black, we wanted ours to be similar."

So again to be clear, 'stealing' symbols used by leftists was one of the strategies fascists used. Even if the ideologies sharply contrast.

Your knowledge of German's history is lacking. Why did the predecessor of the Germany Nazi party fought against German communists in the Rhineland to defend private property during the German revolution?

Your justification for saying that communism and fascism are the same is that both the fascist ideology and Soviet Communism had the state take action. So is the US fascist as well? The US state confiscates property all the time. In times of war the US confiscates money belonging to parties it deems to be the enemy. It also tells weapon manufacturers that they are not allowed to sell their property to certain groups. Is this evidence of the US being anti-capitalist? Your definition of socialism basically being 'state intervention' is misplaced. Every capitalist society relies on state intervention. It is weird to say a society is not capitalist because it has state intervention.

Even the rise of capitalism as an economical system was paired with an extreme amount of state violence under direction of the capitalists as a class. Is the rise of capitalism socialist? Were the capitalists who directed this violence both owners of capital and socialist? If that is your definition of socialism, then you've defined socialism as something that runs completely contrary to any meaningful definition, the history of socialism, and the definition of socialism used by socialists.

Your answer to my question about why Hitler was supported by conservatives is pretty weak. Simply by being a nationalist you are given an important position in the government? Why didn't all of the other nationalists get invited to join the government?

Fascists generally had the support of the army, right-wing paramilitary groups, conservative politicians, religious institutions, monarchists, and the richest capitalists. They were reactionary, anti-leftist, specifically anti-communist, anti-intellectual, racist, pro-private property, and nationalist. Socialists generally had the support of unions, workers, racial minorities, and some intellectuals. They were revolutionary, anti-capitalist, anti-conservative, anti-racist, and anti-nationalist.

Somehow you seem to think that these are the same. I think it comes down to you not liking both, so that's why they are the same. The rest is justifying for yourself why you believe that to be the case, ignoring that they are polar opposites.

Here's Ted weighing in:

> 204\. Revolutionaries should have as many children as they can. There
is strong scientific evidence that social attitudes are to a
significant extent inherited. No one suggests that a social attitude
is a direct outcome of a person's genetic constitution, but it appears
that personality traits tend, within the context of our society, to
make a person more likely to hold this or that social attitude.
Objections to these findings have been raised, but objections are
feeble and seem to be ideologically motivated. In any event, no one
denies that children tend on the average to hold social attitudes
similar to those of their parents. From our point of view it doesn't
matter all that much whether the attitudes are passed on genetically
or through childhood training. In either case the ARE passed on.

> 205\. The trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel
against the industrial system are also concerned about the population
problems, hence they are apt to have few or no children. In this way
they may be handing the world over to the sort of people who support
or at least accept the industrial system. To insure the strength of
the next generation of revolutionaries the present generation must
reproduce itself abundantly. In doing so they will be worsening the
population problem only slightly. And the most important problem is to
get rid of the industrial system, because once the industrial system
is gone the world's population necessarily will decrease (see
paragraph 167); whereas, if the industrial system survives, it will
continue developing new techniques of food production that may enable
the world's population to keep increasing almost indefinitely.

In that case it makes even less sense not to study their motivations. People Breivik and Kaczynski might be 'lone wolves', but as isolated as they were from society, they were still heavily influenced by other people's thoughts and general social currents. Not even attempting to understand them and others like them who are likely out there because it would stroke their ego seems like a completely unnecessary risk.

For instance, take Breivik's manifesto and the many times he mentions 'mainstream' politicians and media commentators who rail against 'Islamofascism' and the threat to Europe that muslim 'mass migration' entails. We can't just pretend that they aren't creating a climate where lunatic mass murderers are swept up by their rhetoric.

Just a side note,

US also wants Japan to surrender ASAP. A full land invasion, while possible, would be much slower, and the Soviet Union is already turning it's Red Army around. Had Japan not surrender as soon as they did, the Soviet Union is likely to mount an offensive from the northern/Manchuria region. This would mean that instead of Korea been split in half and Japan remain as one country, Korea would completely fall to the Soviet with Japan likely split (similar to Germany).

And the whole conflict between the USA and Japan could have been avoided had we not blockaded oil shipments to Japan, as a passive aggressive move to combat their forcibly taking of the Chinese mainland.  Had we not blockaded them, and maintained trade relations, the war in the pacific could have been avoided.  They might have even been our ally from 1934-1945.  We, (and Japan), would be more economically powerful than we currently are, had we played our cards right.  We brought the pacific conflict on ourselves.

It's really also important to remember the scale of the atomic bombings.  They caused fewer outright casualties than the prior bombing campaigns in Japan with conventional bombs.  And the same can be said probably of the bombing campaigns in Europe.  WWII was really just brutal all the way around.  The atomic bombs were just the last icing on a stupid cake.

If you need some other sources you can search on the [WP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator). 

>As the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, matches sine missione were officially banned, a pragmatic Augustan decision that also happened to reflect popular demands for "natural justice". Refusals by Caligula and Claudius to spare popular but defeated fighters did nothing to boost their own popularity. In most circumstances, a gladiator who fought well was likely to be spared.[106]

>Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional munus by Nero, in which no-one was killed, "not even noxii (enemies of the state)."[107]

This was the section I remember reading. [From the Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731):

>In 2007, the Japanese army surgeon Ken Yuasa testified to the Japan Times that, "I was afraid during my first vivisection, but the second time around, it was much easier. By the third time, I was willing to do it." He believes at least 1,000 people, including surgeons, were involved in vivisections over mainland China.

Not sure about where you are from, but I know as a result of the Japanese being with the AXIS, in Canada, we put many people of Japanese origin into camps in BC.  I suspect part of the fear would be people taking it in a way that wasn't appropriate.  I knew one friend who found out about Nankin who was of HK origin, and said, that's why I can't be friends with you anymore to a Japanese origin Canadian.  (she was something like 4th or 5th generation Canadian to boot...)

That said, it might not have been just the child's inability to understand, as this girl mentioned to me that she hated that many parents of friends held that over her, and made her feel like she should feel ashamed for it, when her family was locked away in a camp in BC, Canada...

Oh come on, for a movie that portrays itself as a sci-fi comedy, and turns out to be a slightly comedic, romantic drama, that was still a pretty decent movie.

But now that I think about it, I watched God Bless America at around the same time, and it was better. So maybe my emotional memory is thinking of it instead.

Not even remotely what I'm saying.  I'm saying an avalanche hit, then a blizzard, making the survivors hypthermic and blowing away the snow.  In their hypothermic daze they removed their clothes and fled, dying of exposure.  The footprints come after the snow is deposited.  Even then, the fact that there were survivors indicates the avalanche didn't bury them very deep, if at all.  It just hit and sprayed, like a wave hitting a building.

To be blunt; i'm against virtually all the wars the UK has fought since the first Gulf war, and don't trust our government with very much at all... I'm not sure. But the point is; if you killed someone or blew up a bus or whatever; I seriously do not give a damn why you did it.

Look, if you aren't going to acknowledge the actions taken by the Japanese at all, and just lay ALL of the blame on the US as though Japan is run by children, then there is no point in arguing with you. It was not within the USA's interests to have Japan gain that much land and strength because there was no guarantee they would be allies, if anything, it was highly likely the Japanese would have continued their imperialist expansion as they were known to do and attack the US anyway.

Ok, son, my point is that the possibility of having to send your soldiers into war doesn't justify attacking innocent civilians. You don't know definitely what would happen in a war, but you know exactly what will happen when you drop massive bombs on a city of innocents. Soldiers and civilians are not the same In a war.

He barely held on to the Persian lands by the time he got to India.  His men were pissed, exhausted, and ready to mutiny unless he agreed to turn around.  Even his grip on greece was weak. He may have defeated an organized Persian army and set up a few cities but he would have had rebellion and his ass handed to him within a matter of years in the asian lands he conquered.  It would have cost him greatly in the end and I highly doubt his style of warfare and all the hop lites in greece couldn't have fought against guerilla forces and won.  He saw his success from an overconfident emperor who met him on the open battle field thinking he could win with numbers alone.

>In the earliest munera, death was considered the proper outcome of combat. During the Imperial era, matches were sometimes advertised sine missione (without release [from the sentence of death]), which suggests that missio (the sparing of a defeated gladiator's life) had become a common practice at the games.


>"He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword." The gladiator's oath as cited by Petronius (Satyricon, 117).


Also, I only see where this addresses Gladiator vs. Gladiator combat, when it was said that the Romans would send unarmed slaves (Non-gladiators) to fight with beasts from far away lands, most notably the lion or crocodiles.

No offense was meant for the request for citation, but 'common knowledge' does not stand as a defense alone. For instance, it is 'common knowledge' to Christians that they were fed to wild beasts in the arena as a form of matyrdom.

What happened between the HK friend and the Japanese friend is more a result of the surprise of learning that fact so late than a result of the fact by itself having happened. My point is, the sooner you know the reality of the facts, the sooner you can cope with it. Maybe that the HK friend reacted in the heat of the moment, or maybe he was just trying to rekindle some sense of belonging (culturally, asian cultures are closer to their ancestors than most other cultures).

i don't know of which nationality you are, but if you belong to a nationality where your countrymen are split into two different countries (east and west germany, usa and confederacy, china and taiwan, ireland and north ireland, etc.), the citizens of their respective countries, as well as their political leaders, all want to reunify, whether or not it would be expensive. it isn't as if south korea is some poor country, in fact, for the tiny amount of actual land south korea occupies, the fact that it's 11th (last i checked a year or two ago) largest economic country is pretty amazing. and then to top it off, koreans are a very prideful people.

And fair enough, I'd say. I think that's exactly what security agencies should be tracking. If metadata could show that someone is buying large quantities of fertilizer, the Unabomber Manifesto and lots of metal pipes, I find the idea that the government is capable of recognizing them as a threat comforting. That doesn't mean that the state should be allowed to arrest, let alone incarcerate them on that evidence alone, but it should give them the ability to ask some questions. 

I have bought and read many strange books that could be seen as red flags, and I'm sure those actions are traceable somehow, but it doesn't worry me at least as long as I live in a country where habeas corpus is in effect.

We should have kept out of it. It did not affect us what Imperialist Japan was doing in the Asian corridor. They were a trading partner, and nothing more. Prior to WWII, the US military might ranked 37th in the world, just behind Portugal.

We should have asked the age old question of "How does it affect me?" Since the answer would have been, "Not at all"; we should have kept out of it. We only became "Team America: World Police" in 1946, after WWII, on the onset of the cold war.

I guess it depends on what you think.  I personally suspect that the way in which it was told to her was inspired with passion and designed to get that sort of reaction (think The Passion...).  I am all for looking at our dark pasts and other's dark pasts.  I mean if we look back far enough everyone has killed everyone at some point.  I would hope that the way it would be taught, is that it is something we must learn to not let repeat.  As that is at least one of the goals of bothering to teach history and remember.  IMHO I can imagine some k-value of age where the learner would be too young for any given subject matter.  For instance my young baby was born premature, so was too young to swallow and suck in coordination.  That said, I agree that in many cultures we have moved in certain topics to thinking people are not old enough to understand.  Sex probably being the number one culprit in many cultures.  I mean really if it comes down to understanding reproduction and knowing calculus, we have certain priorities as a species... that said, there are so many of us now... that maybe we aren't worried about survival at this point.. (sorry to go way on a tangent, avoided my morning coffee so incoherency seems to be a side effect...).

You *are* familiar with physics right?  You know how a very thin wave can break bones when it hits right?

Also the condition isn't at all "rare" since it's temperature dependent, so at a certain temperature (like one induced from below freezing temperatures coupled with wind shear and an avalanche) everyone's gonna start feeling the effects.  In essence you're saying it's weird that people would all need oxygen tanks to operate at high temperatures, that there wouldn't be a single person capable of operating without one.  No shit there isn't anyone who could keep their wits about them, they're all only people, and hypothermia isn't some muscle or toxin that you can build up an immunity to.

It most certainly did affect the US. At the time the US was still suffering the depression. FDR had made several strides in that area, but the economy still wasn't self sustaining. Until a greater demand from foreign nations participating in the war called for greater foreign trade from the US. Guess where the majority of foreign trade was going?

I'll give you a hint, it wasn't Japan. (And I mean that before the cease of trade.)

So the answer to the age old question 'How does it affect me?' is "A fuck of a lot." It was in the USA's best interests for Japan and Germany to lose the war in order to solidify its economic and military might. 

In a war, one side is going to win. Both Japan and Germany had expressed immense imperialistic desires, and of course that kind of behaviour coming from Japan, in the Pacific, is very intimidating to the USA. It would be a very, very stupid move to have sided with the Japanese over the allies, especially considering the US had sided with the allies once before in WW1. There was MORE to gain by entering the war, not less.

No but seriously, in an age of live satellite feeds and up-to-date intelligence that would *obviously* be focused around use of buildings in a built up environment - can you not accept that saying "old maps" is a ridiculous thing to say?

Also, in a world where WMDs were proven to be bullshit and no major construction projects have been completed in Afghanistan - is it completely out of the question that there may be a conspiracy at any time?

You lose.

You are losing.

Those feeling you have of "having something better to do" or thinking I'm a loser or whatever - all those feelings are your brain trying to protect your ego from the truth. 

You lost an argument on the internet to a stranger and now you are pretending like you have something important to do, because it hurts.

It's not coulda woulda shoulda. He defeated many armies in the field, not the people of the region. What he did was impressive, very impressive, but there was never time to see an actual occupation stuggle. A finite number of battles against a unified army is one thing and is entirely different from fighting against all the people, cities, and tribes at the time. There's a big difference.  His army was far too small and broken to hold onto it for any length of time. If he had lived and went back in for round two it would have been a disaster.

Not our problem. It didn't affect us, so we had no reason to engage Japan in an oil embargo, (which led to the pearl harbor attack). Prior to WWII, the US military was the 37^th most powerful nation, right behind Portugal. It shouldn't have been our concern what the Japs were doing in the Asia Pacific theater. They should have remained nothing more than a trading partner.

Probably gone on with going all-in for the Soviet Union, who didn't have much oil, but had all the other mineral wealth the Japanese needed during the time. This COULD potentially have meant the SU simply not having the trained winter troops to hold off the Germans outside of Moscow because they can't move their trained and winter-equipped Far East divisions from the Manchurian border, or be stuck in a two-front war.

TL;DR Soviets would have likely been in a much more difficult position in 1941 fighting on two fronts.

Slightly different.  Hitler wanted all of Europe to be part of "Greater Germania" in his egotistical fantasy world.  Japan just wanted resources in the Asia-pacific corridor.  Yes, they were racists, and "Jap-Supremacists", but only made war against other Asian countries.  They wanted to expand their sphere of influence to control resources, not exterminate all "untermenschen schweinhund" because of perceived racial superiority.  

As far as how different it would have turned out, they would be a slightly different version of modern China, but mostly consisting of islands instead of one large land mass.  For the japs, it was "[all about the Benjamins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTBb1u6UGg)"

You act as if this is an argument.  It isn't.  I'm simply relating what I know about the incident.  The truth is that my father was the supreme allied commander during the war.  I was in the house when the embassy was hit and everyone freaked the fuck out over it because it was not an intended target.  So yes, when I know the actual truth of something and somebody wants to argue that, no, I need to prove it to them, all I can give you is my word that I was there.  If you choose not to accept it and believe something that isn't true, that's your call.  I'm not trying to win or lose, I'm just telling you something I experienced that is relevant to the topic.

It is the very definition of coulda shoulda woulda. You don't have to defeat each and every one of the people in a region to claim you conquered it, otherwise no conqueror ever succeeded in conquering any enemy territory, since there would always be at least one resisting the occupation, either openly or in secret. He went, he saw, he conquered. Many of the people whose territory he conquered accepted him as a liberator, since they were already occupied forcefully by the Persians, and his tactic of elevating all able men in his ranks, no matter where they came from, maybe raised objections from the Greeks, but if you want to go coulda shoulda woulda then if he hadn't contracted malaria the Greeks would be too few to object too loudly, compared to the rest of his Unified Empire which was all too happy to exchange Darius for Alexander.

Have you heard of the Rape of Nanjing?  Perhaps Unit 731 rings a bell? How about the Bataan Death March?  They were racists who happily engaged in the slaughter of those considered beneath them.  Why don't you drag your revisionist dogshit [where it belongs](http://www.stormfront.org).

To say that Japan fought only for resources is an extremely narrow view. Nearly all of the countries surrounding Japan were facing hard times and presented easy targets for invasion.  China was battered by a civil war, and the European colonies in the area were wide open for attack as their mother countries had to focus on the homefront. Japan realized that it could become a serious power if it expanded so it took advantage of this. Of course the resources were great, but it was about power.

Oh no, it is an argument when you dismiss opinions that contradict your analysis as "conspiracy theory"

So the fact that the Nazis existed should stop modern governments from looking askance at people spreading racial hatred?

I'm on my mobile, so no I didn't. My point is still valid. We should have kept out of it. It's not our concern, (or rather it shouldn't be), whether a nation is full of racists, and is waging genocide against a target population.

Not our problem. It didn't affect us, so we had no reason to engage Japan in an oil embargo, (which led to the pearl harbor attack). Prior to WWII, the US military was the 37^th most powerful nation, right behind Portugal. It shouldn't have been our concern what the Japs were doing in the Asia Pacific theater. They should have remained nothing more than a trading partner.

Also some of them were cut open from the inside, almost like they were encased in some sort of...idk...snow?  Some sort of easily deposited but difficult to remove substance that would prevent them from freeing themselves after becoming entangled...like the exact sort of thing that gets deposited in an avalanche.

Seriously do you know anything about what happened?

No. It should be a cautionary tale for governments that imagine they should control what written material citizens have access to. And before you say it, yes monitoring book purchases is a soft form of censorship.

Restricting access to written material isn't really what the Nazis are being condemned for. Many countries such as Germany have decided that censoring books like Mein Kampf and regalia like the Swastika are forms of censorship that are beneficial to society, and in those instances I have to agree.

Just because you're uncomfortable, doesn't make it any less true. I would rather embrace reality as it is, rather than persist in believing a delusion.

You just string words together hoping they sound intelligent, don't you?

Here's a hint - masking an utterly retarded idea behind semi-intelligent speech doesn't change the fact that what you're saying is utterly retarded.  That which is devoid of substance will remain so no matter how you dress it up.
